Mode 1: Direct Aggregation
Logic: This is the most straightforward mode. It involves counting respondents based on one or two simple, direct filters. It answers the question "Count the respondents with property X."

Format Examples:
Count the respondents from '[Country]'.

Count the respondents with more than [Number] years of total coding experience.

Count the respondents who have worked with the '[Language]' language.

Concrete Example:
Count the respondents from the 'United States of America'.

Mode 2: Multi-Conditional Aggregation
Logic: This mode increases complexity by combining three or more conditions. It can also involve filters based on simple calculations derived from an individual respondent's own data or multiple text/list searches.

Format Examples:
Count the respondents from '[Country]' with an education level of '[EdLevel]' who have worked with '[Language]'.

Count the respondents with between [Number A] and [Number B] years of total coding experience who work with the '[Tool]' tool.

Count the respondents who are '[Employment Status]' and whose yearly compensation is over [Amount].

Concrete Example:
Count the respondents who are 'Employed, full-time', use 'Docker', and have worked with 'Bash/Shell'.

Mode 3: Comparative Aggregation
Logic: This is the most advanced mode. It involves counting respondents based on a comparison to a group-level aggregate. The system must first calculate a benchmark (like an average or median for a specific subgroup) and then use that benchmark to filter and count the final set of respondents.

Format Examples:
Count the respondents whose total compensation (yearly) is higher than the average compensation for their country.

Count the respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.

Count the respondents who have worked with a language that is also one of the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents.

Concrete Example:
Count the respondents whose total years of coding experience is greater than the average for their country.
