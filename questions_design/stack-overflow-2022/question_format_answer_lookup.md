Easy Mode
Logic: The respondent is identified using one or two direct, explicit criteria like their ID or a simple demographic filter.

Format Examples:
What is the [Feature: e.g., 'Life satisfaction' score] of respondent '[ID]'?

What is the [Feature: e.g., 'Year of birth'] of the respondent with the highest [Well-being Score Type]?

What is the [Feature] of the [Gender] respondent born in [Year]?

Concrete Example:
What is the 'Year of birth' of respondent '71'?

Medium Mode
Logic: The respondent is identified by combining three or more criteria. This often involves finding a superlative (e.g., highest or lowest score) within a specific group or performing a simple calculation on a respondent's own scores.

Format Examples:
What is the [Feature] of the [Gender] respondent with the highest [Score Type] among those born in [Year]?

What is the [Feature] of the respondent born in [Year] with a 'Socio-economic status' of [Number] and a 'Worry' score of [Number]?

What is the [Feature] of the respondent whose total score for 'Worry' and 'Stress' was exactly [Number]?

Concrete Example:
What is the mother's years of education for the male respondent born in 2004 who has a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8?

Really Hard Mode
Logic: Identifying the respondent requires an initial calculation or aggregation (like an average) on a subgroup of the data. The filter itself is based on a derived value that must be computed first.

Format Examples:
What is the [Feature] of the [Gender] respondent whose [Score Type] is lower than the average [Score Type] for all respondents of the opposite gender?

What is the [Feature] of the respondent with the highest total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score who also has a 'Life satisfaction' score below the overall average?

What is the [Feature] of the respondent whose [Demographic Feature] is the same as the respondent with the lowest combined score for 'Worry', 'Stress', and 'Loneliness'?

Concrete Example:
What is the 'Loneliness' score of the respondent who has the highest 'Happiness' score among all individuals whose 'Worry' score is lower than the average 'Worry' score for the entire group?
