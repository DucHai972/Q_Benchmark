Of course. Here are the easy, medium, and really hard question formats for the conceptual aggregation task, tailored to your developer survey dataset.

The goal of this task is to return a count of respondents who match a given set of criteria.

Easy Mode
Logic: The count is based on one or two simple, direct filters on categorical, numerical, or list-based features.

Format Examples:
How many respondents are from '[Country]'?

Count the respondents with more than [Number] years of professional coding experience.

How many respondents have worked with the '[Language]' language?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents have worked with the 'Python' language?

Medium Mode
Logic: The count is based on a combination of three or more filters, which can include calculations, negative conditions, or multiple list/text matching conditions.

Format Examples:
How many respondents from '[Country]' with an education level of '[EdLevel]' have worked with '[Language]'?

Count the respondents with between [Number A] and [Number B] years of total coding experience who work with the '[Tool]' tool.

How many respondents have a yearly compensation over [Amount] and do not use '[VCS]' for version control?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents who are 'Employed, full-time' have worked with both 'Docker' and 'npm'?

Really Hard Mode
Logic: The count is based on criteria that first require an aggregate calculation (like an average) on a subgroup of the data. The filter itself is based on a derived value.

Format Examples:
How many respondents have a total compensation (yearly) that is higher than the average compensation for their country?

Count the respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.

How many respondents have worked with a language that is also one of the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents in their same organization size?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents have more years of professional coding experience than the average for all respondents with the same education level?
