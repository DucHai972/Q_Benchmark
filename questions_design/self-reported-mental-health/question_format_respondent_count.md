Easy Mode
Logic: This is the most straightforward mode. It involves counting respondents based on one or two simple, direct filters. It answers the question "Count the respondents with property X."

Format Examples:
Count the respondents who are [Gender: e.g., male].

Count the respondents with a [Score Type] of [Number] or higher.

Count the respondents with a 'Socio-economic status' of [Number] who were born in [Year].

Concrete Example:
Count the respondents born before 2004.

Medium Mode
Logic: This mode increases complexity by combining three or more conditions. It can also involve filters based on simple calculations derived from an individual respondent's own data (e.g., a total score).

Format Examples:
Count the respondents born in [Year] who have a [Score A] greater than [Number] and a [Score B] less than [Number].

Count the respondents whose total score for 'Worry' and 'Stress' is exactly [Number].

Count the [Gender] respondents whose mother has more than [Number] years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is [Number] or higher.

Concrete Example:
Count the male respondents with a 'Socio-economic status' of 3 or less who reported a 'Happiness' score of 8 or more.

Really Hard mode
Logic: This is the most advanced mode. It involves counting respondents based on a comparison to a group-level aggregate. The system must first calculate a benchmark (like an average or median for a specific subgroup) and then use that benchmark to filter and count the final set of respondents.

Format Examples:
Count the respondents whose [Score Type] is higher than the average [Score Type] for their gender.

Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.

Count the respondents whose total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group.

Concrete Example:
Count the respondents whose combined 'Worry' and 'Stress' score is lower than the average combined 'Worry' and 'Stress' score for their gender.
