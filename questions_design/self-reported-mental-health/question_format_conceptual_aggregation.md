Easy Mode
Logic: The count is based on one or two simple, direct filters on common fields.

Format Examples:
How many respondents are [Gender: e.g., male]?

Count the respondents with a [Score Type] of [Number] or higher.

How many respondents with a 'Socio-economic status' of [Number] were born in [Year]?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents are female?

Medium Mode
Logic: The count is based on a combination of three or more filters, which can include simple calculations on a respondent's own scores or negative conditions.

Format Examples:
How many respondents born in [Year] have a [Score A] greater than [Number] and a [Score B] less than [Number]?

Count the respondents whose total score for 'Worry' and 'Stress' is exactly [Number].

How many [Gender] respondents have a mother with more than [Number] years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of [Number] or higher?

Concrete Example:
How many female respondents born after 2002 have a combined 'Worry' and 'Stress' score of 3 or less?

Really Hard Mode
Logic: The count is based on criteria that first require an aggregate calculation (like an average) on a subgroup of the data. The filter itself is based on a derived value.

Format Examples:
How many respondents have a [Score Type] that is higher than the average [Score Type] for their gender?

Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.

How many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score that is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' score for their gender?
