Easy Mode
Logic: Applies a simple numerical rule to one or two fields. The rule usually involves a direct comparison (>, <, =) or a simple range.

Format Examples:
Which respondents have a [Score Type] greater than [Number]?

Find all respondents whose [Demographic Feature] is between [Number A] and [Number B].

List all [Gender] respondents born before [Year].

Concrete Example:
Which respondents have a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8 or higher?

Medium Mode
Logic: Applies a rule to a calculated field (like a total score for a symptom category) or combines multiple numerical and categorical rules to create a more specific filter.

Format Examples:
Find all respondents whose total score for '[Symptom Category]' is greater than [Number].

Which [Gender] respondents born after [Year] have a '[Score A]' score of [Number] and a '[Score B]' score of less than [Number]?

List all respondents whose '[Score A]' is greater than their '[Score B]'.

Concrete Example:
Find all respondents whose combined 'Worry' and 'Stress' score is exactly 5.

Really Hard Mode
Logic: Applies a rule that requires comparing an individual's value to a pre-calculated group aggregate (like an average or median). The rule is relative to a property of the group, not a fixed value.

Format Examples:
Find all respondents whose '[Score Type]' is greater than the average '[Score Type]' for their [Grouping Feature: e.g., Gender].

Which respondents have a total '[Symptom Category]' score that is lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year?

List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same 'Socio-economic status' group.

Concrete Example:
Which respondents have a 'Laughter' score that is lower than the average 'Laughter' score for their gender?
