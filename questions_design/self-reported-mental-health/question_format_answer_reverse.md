Of course. Here are the easy, medium, and really hard question formats for the answer reverse lookup task, tailored to your survey dataset.

The goal of this task is to find all respondents who match a given set of criteria.

Easy Mode
Logic: The criteria involve one or two simple, direct filters on common fields, which may result in multiple respondents.

Format Examples:
Which respondents are [Gender: e.g., male]?

Find all respondents with a [Score Type] of [Number].

List all respondents with a 'Socio-economic status' of [Number] who were born in [Year].

Concrete Example:
Which respondents were born in 2004?

Medium Mode
Logic: The criteria involve a combination of three or more filters, which can include simple calculations on a respondent's own scores or negative conditions.

Format Examples:
Find all respondents born in [Year] with a [Score A] greater than [Number] and a [Score B] less than [Number].

Which respondents have a total score for 'Worry' and 'Stress' of exactly [Number]?

List all [Gender] respondents whose mother has more than [Number] years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is [Number] or higher.

Concrete Example:
Find all male respondents whose combined 'Worry' and 'Stress' score is exactly 4.

Really Hard Mode
Logic: The criteria require an aggregate calculation (like an average) on a subgroup of the data to define the filter. This means the system must first analyze a group to derive a value before it can find the final list of respondents.

Format Examples:
Find all respondents whose [Score Type] is higher than the average [Score Type] for their gender.

Which respondents were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'?

List all respondents whose total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group.

Concrete Example:
Find all respondents whose 'Laughter' score is less than the average 'Laughter' score for their gender.
