Easy Mode
Logic: The criteria involve one or two simple, direct filters on common fields, which may result in multiple respondents.

Format Examples:
Which respondents participated in a '[Session Name]' session?

Find all respondents who scored [Number] on '[Score Type]'.

List all respondents from sessions on '[Date]' who scored [Number] on '[Score Type]'.

Concrete Example:
Which respondents scored 3 on 'Situation'?

Medium Mode
Logic: The criteria involve a combination of three or more filters, which can include simple calculations on a respondent's own scores, negative conditions, or text matching.

Format Examples:
Find all respondents from the '[Session Name]' session who scored [Number] on '[Score A]' and [Number] on '[Score B]'.

Which respondents have a total score for '[Score A]' and '[Score B]' greater than [Number]?

List all respondents who scored [Number] on '[Score Type]' and whose 'Comments' contain the word '[keyword]'.

Concrete Example:
Which respondents scored 3 on 'Global Rating Scale' and whose comments contain the word 'Good'?

Really Hard Mode
Logic: The criteria require an aggregate calculation (like an average) on a subgroup of the data to define the filter. This means the system must first analyze a group to derive a value before it can find the final list of respondents.

Format Examples:
Find all respondents whose '[Score Type]' is higher than the average '[Score Type]' for all sessions on the same date.

Which respondents participated in a session where the average '[Score Type]' for that session name is greater than [Number]?

List all respondents who scored perfectly on '[Score A]' and '[Score B]' and whose '[Score C]' is below the average for all sessions containing '[keyword]' in the name.

Concrete Example:
Find all respondents who participated in a session on a date where the average 'Situation' score for all sessions on that day was a perfect 3.
