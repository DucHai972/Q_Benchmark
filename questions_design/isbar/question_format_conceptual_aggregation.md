Easy Mode
Logic: The count is based on one or two simple, direct filters on common fields.

Format Examples:
How many respondents participated in a '[Session Name]' session?

Count the respondents who scored [Number] on '[Score Type]'.

How many respondents from sessions on '[Date]' scored [Number] on '[Score Type]'?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents participated in an 'I - MI' session?

Medium Mode
Logic: The count is based on a combination of three or more filters, which can include simple calculations on a respondent's own scores, negative conditions, or text matching.

Format Examples:
How many respondents from the '[Session Name]' session scored [Number] on '[Score A]' and [Number] on '[Score B]'?

Count the respondents whose total score for '[Score A]' and '[Score B]' is greater than [Number].

How many respondents who scored [Number] on '[Score Type]' also have 'Comments' that contain the word '[keyword]'?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents scored 3 on 'Global Rating Scale' and have 'Comments' that contain the word 'Satisfactory'?

Really Hard Mode
Logic: The count is based on criteria that first require an aggregate calculation (like an average) on a subgroup of the data. The filter itself is based on a derived value.

Format Examples:
How many respondents have a '[Score Type]' score that is higher than the average '[Score Type]' for all sessions on the same date?

Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average '[Score Type]' for that session name is greater than [Number].

How many respondents whose comments contain '[keyword]' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents are in sessions where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is 2.5 or higher?
