Easy Mode
Logic: The respondent is identified using one or two direct, explicit criteria like their ID, the session name, or the date.

Format Examples:
What is the [Feature: e.g., 'Comments'] of respondent '[ID]'?

What is the [Feature: e.g., 'Situation' score] of the respondent from the '[Session Name]' session on '[Date]'?

Concrete Example:
What is the 'Situation' score of respondent '8'?

Medium Mode
Logic: The respondent is identified by combining three or more criteria. This often involves finding a superlative (e.g., highest or lowest score) within a specific group or performing a simple calculation on a respondent's own scores.

Format Examples:
What is the [Feature] of the respondent with the highest [Score Type] in the '[Session Name]' session?

What is the [Feature] of the respondent from the '[Session Name]' session whose score for '[Score A]' was [Number] and score for '[Score B]' was [Number]?

What is the [Feature] of the respondent whose total score for '[Score A]' and '[Score B]' was exactly [Number]?

Concrete Example:
What are the 'Comments' from the respondent with the highest 'Assessment' score in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session?

Really Hard Mode
Logic: Identifying the respondent requires an initial calculation or aggregation (like an average) on a subgroup of the data. The filter itself is based on a derived value that must be computed first.

Format Examples:
What is the [Feature] of the respondent from the '[Session Name]' session whose [Score Type] is higher than the average [Score Type] for all sessions on '[Date]'?

What is the [Feature] of the respondent with the highest total score across all rubric items who also participated in a '[Session Name]' session?

What is the [Feature] of the respondent whose comment contains '[keyword]' and whose 'Global Rating Scale' score is higher than the average for their specific session name?

Concrete Example:
What is the 'Global Rating Scale' score of the respondent from the 'Sepsis' session whose 'Situation' score is higher than the average 'Situation' score for all sessions that occurred on '2025-05-02'?
