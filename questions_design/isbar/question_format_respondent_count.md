Easy Mode
Logic: This is the most straightforward mode. It involves counting respondents based on one or two simple, direct filters. It answers the question "Count the respondents with property X."

Format Examples:
Count the respondents who participated in a '[Session Name]' session.

Count the respondents who scored [Number] on '[Score Type]'.

Count the respondents from sessions on '[Date]' who scored [Number] on '[Score Type]'.

Concrete Example:
Count the respondents who participated in a session on '2025-05-02'.

Medium Mode
Logic: This mode increases complexity by combining three or more conditions. It can also involve filters based on simple calculations derived from an individual respondent's own data (e.g., a total score or a date duration).

Format Examples:
Count the respondents from the '[Session Name]' session who scored [Number] on '[Score A]' and [Number] on '[Score B]'.

Count the respondents whose total score for '[Score A]' and '[Score B]' is greater than [Number].

Count the respondents who scored [Number] on '[Score Type]' and whose 'Comments' contain the word '[keyword]'.

Concrete Example:
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Global Rating Scale' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Good'.

Really Hard Mode
Logic: This is the most advanced mode. It involves counting respondents based on a comparison to a group-level aggregate. The system must first calculate a benchmark (like an average or median for a specific subgroup) and then use that benchmark to filter and count the final set of respondents.

Format Examples:
Count the respondents whose '[Score Type]' is higher than the average '[Score Type]' for all sessions on the same date.

Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average '[Score Type]' for that session name is greater than [Number].

Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.

Concrete Example:
Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is equal to the average 'Assessment' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
