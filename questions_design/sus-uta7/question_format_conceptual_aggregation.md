Here are the easy, medium, and really hard question formats for the conceptual aggregation task, tailored to your System Usability Scale (SUS) survey dataset.

The goal of this task is to return a count of respondents who match a given set of criteria.

Easy Mode
Logic: The count is based on one or two simple, direct filters on common fields.

Format Examples:
How many respondents are in the '[Group]' group?

Count the respondents who rated '[Score_Type]' as [Number].

How many respondents from the '[Group]' rated '[Score_Type]' as [Number]?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents are in the 'Middle' group?

Medium Mode
Logic: The count is based on a combination of three or more filters, which can include simple calculations on a respondent's own scores or negative conditions.

Format Examples:
How many respondents from the '[Group]' group rated '[Score_A]' as [Number] and '[Score_B]' as [Number]?

Count the respondents whose combined score for '[Score_A]' and '[Score_B]' is less than [Number].

How many respondents rated '[Score_A]' and '[Score_B]' with the same score?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents from the 'Middle' group have a 'System_Complexity' score of 1?

Really Hard Mode
Logic: The count is based on criteria that first require an aggregate calculation (like an average) on a subgroup of the data. The filter itself is based on a derived value.

Format Examples:
How many respondents in the '[Group_A]' group have a '[Score_Type]' score that is higher than the average '[Score_Type]' for the '[Group_B]' group?

Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?

Concrete Example:
How many respondents have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group?
