Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.\n\nYou will be given a dataset with two key parts:\n\nA 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.\n\nA 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.\n\nOUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:\nProvide your final answer directly and concisely. Your output should contain only the answer itself, without explaining your thought process or methodology. For example:\n\nIf the question asks for a count, provide only the final number (e.g., \"42\").\n\nIf the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide them as a simple comma-separated list (e.g., \"17, 21, 23\").\n\nIf the question asks for a specific text comment, provide only that text.\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich respondent numbers are exactly 51 years old?\n\nDATA:\n\n[Insert the full data block here]",
