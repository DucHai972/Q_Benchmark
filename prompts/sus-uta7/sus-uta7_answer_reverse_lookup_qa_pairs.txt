You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Your output should contain only the answer itself, without explaining your thought process or methodology. For example:

If the question asks for a count, provide only the final number (e.g., "42").

If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide them as a simple comma-separated list (e.g., "17, 21, 23").

If the question asks for a specific text comment, provide only that text.
