<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 17?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions and corresponding responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent's data includes open-ended fields such as Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based scores for Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, with detailed descriptions provided in the questions section to interpret each score. The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective answers to each question. This structure allows for precise evaluation of each respondent's performance based on the rubric criteria.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 17?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions and corresponding responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and several rubric-based ratings assessing identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation, and a global rating scale. The global rating scale measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, scored from 0 (not confident) to 3 (confident with little or no questioning). Comments provide qualitative feedback on each session. The data is structured in HTML format with clear separation between questions and individual respondent answers.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

What is the identification score for respondent 2?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions defining each field, including open-ended and rubric-based scoring items. Each respondent's data includes a date, session name, and scores for identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation, and a global rating scale. Identification is scored from 0 to 3, indicating the completeness and spontaneity of self-introduction. The responses section lists individual respondent data with their respective answers to each question. This structure allows for precise extraction of specific data points per respondent.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with two main sections: a 'Questions' section that defines each field and its meaning, including rubrics for scoring various competencies, and a 'Responses' section that records individual respondent answers. Each respondent's data includes open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based scores for Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. The Identification field specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, scored from 0 to 3. The responses are structured in HTML with each respondent's data grouped under their respective headings.

What is the identification score for respondent 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data with two main sections: a 'Questions' section that defines each field and its meaning, including rubrics for scoring various competencies, and a 'Responses' section that records individual respondent answers. Each respondent's data includes open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based scores for Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. The Identification field specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, scored from 0 to 3. The responses are structured in HTML format, with each respondent's data grouped under their respective heading.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 11?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical sessions, including open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based rating scales for Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. Each respondent's answers are listed under their ID, with scores ranging from 0 to 3 for rubric questions indicating levels of performance or confidence. The Assessment field specifically measures the logical assessment quality, scored from 0 (no logical assessment) to 3 (comprehensive logical assessment without questioning). The data allows comparison of respondents' performance on various clinical communication and assessment skills.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 11?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions and corresponding responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent's data includes the date of the session, session name, and several rubric-based ratings assessing identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation, and a global rating scale. The global rating scale measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, scored from 0 (not confident) to 3 (confident with little or no questioning). Comments are open-ended and provide qualitative feedback on the session. The data is structured in HTML format with clear separation between questions and individual respondent answers.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 10?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions related to clinical session evaluations, including open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based scoring fields such as Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). Each respondent's answers are recorded under their respective ID, with scores ranging from 0 to 3 indicating levels of performance or confidence. The Assessment field specifically measures the logical assessment ability, scored from 0 (no logical assessment) to 3 (comprehensive logical assessment without questioning). The data is structured in HTML format with clear separation between questions and responses. This allows for precise extraction of individual respondent scores for each category.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions defining each field, including open-ended and rubric-based ratings. Each respondent's data includes the date, session name, and scores for identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation (clear recommendation and global rating scale), and comments. The global rating scale measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, scored from 0 (not confident) to 3 (confident with little or no questioning). Responses are structured by respondent ID, with each field's value provided. The data allows precise extraction of specific respondent scores or answers based on the schema.

What is the session name for respondent 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions defining each field, including open-ended questions like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based rating scales for Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. Each respondent's answers are recorded under their respondent number, with values corresponding to the schema definitions. The data captures both qualitative and quantitative assessments of session performance. The SessionName field is an open-ended text describing the session's title or focus. This structure allows for detailed analysis of individual respondent sessions and their evaluations.

What is the identification score for respondent 23?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions and corresponding responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and several rubric-based scores assessing various aspects such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a global rating scale. The Identification field measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, scored from 0 to 3 with detailed criteria. Responses are structured in HTML format, with each respondent's answers listed under their respective headings. The data allows for direct extraction of specific scores or text answers based on the respondent ID.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 19?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions and corresponding responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and several scored rubric items assessing various aspects of a session such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a global rating scale. The Identification field specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, scored from 0 to 3. Scores are numeric and represent levels of completeness and prompting required. Comments provide qualitative feedback on the session.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The table contains survey data with two main sections: a 'Questions' section that defines each field and its meaning, including open-ended questions and rubric-based ratings; and a 'Responses' section that records individual respondent answers to these fields. Each respondent's data includes the date of the session, session name, and various rubric scores assessing identification, situation, background, assessment, recommendation, and confidence levels, along with comments. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating levels of completeness or confidence. The session name is an open-ended field specifying the name or topic of the session. This structure allows for detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of each respondent's session.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The table contains survey data with two main sections: a 'Questions' section that defines each field and its meaning, including open-ended questions and rubric-based ratings; and a 'Responses' section that records individual respondent answers to these fields. Each respondent's data includes the date of the session, session name, and various rubric scores assessing identification, situation, background, assessment, recommendation, and confidence levels, along with comments. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or confidence. The session name is an open-ended field specifying the name or topic of the session. This structure allows for detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of each respondent's session.

What is the identification score for respondent 14?
</task>","The table contains survey data with a set of questions and corresponding responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent's data includes open-ended fields such as Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based scores for Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). The Identification score measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, with scores ranging from 0 (requires direct prompting) to 3 (complete introduction). The responses section lists individual respondent data with their respective answers to each question. This structure allows for detailed analysis of each respondent's performance and session details.
