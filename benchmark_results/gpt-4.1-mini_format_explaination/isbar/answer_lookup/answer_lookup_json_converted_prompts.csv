<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 17?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions and rubric-based scoring for various aspects such as Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. Each respondent's answers are recorded with scores or text responses corresponding to these questions. The Identification field is scored from 0 to 3, indicating the level of self-introduction and completeness of information. The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective answers to each question. This structure allows for detailed analysis of each respondent's performance and session details.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the date for respondent 13?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based rating scales for Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with numeric scores corresponding to rubric levels or open-ended text responses. The data is structured to capture both qualitative and quantitative assessments of session performance. Respondents are identified by unique respondent numbers, and their answers are recorded in a nested format. This structure allows for detailed analysis of individual session evaluations.

What is the identification score for respondent 2?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scoring questions (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background history and examination, Assessment, Recommendation). Each rubric question has a defined scoring scale from 0 to 3, describing levels of performance or completeness. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question. The Identification score measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, with 0 meaning requires direct prompting and 3 meaning complete introduction without prompting. Respondent 2's Identification score is provided as a numeric value corresponding to this rubric.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 5?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scoring questions (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). Each rubric question has a defined scale from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or completeness. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question. The Identification score measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, with 0 meaning ""Requires direct prompting"" and 3 meaning ""Introduces themselves and information is complete.""

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 3?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based rating scales for Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with numeric scores corresponding to rubric levels or open-ended text responses. The rubric scores indicate the quality or completeness of the respondent's performance or observations, with higher numbers generally indicating better performance. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID and their corresponding answers. This structure allows for detailed analysis of each session's characteristics and respondent performance.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Each rubric question has a defined scoring scale from 0 to 3 (or -1 for missing data), describing the quality or completeness of the respondent's performance. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question, allowing for analysis of their session performance. The Identification score specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, with scores ranging from 0 (requires prompting) to 3 (complete introduction).

What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 10?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to clinical session evaluations, including open-ended questions and rubric-based scoring for various clinical competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendations. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with scores ranging from 0 to 3 for rubric-based items indicating levels of performance or confidence. The ""Assessment"" field specifically measures the logical assessment ability of the respondent, with higher scores indicating more comprehensive and independent assessments. The data is structured as JSON with a clear schema defining each question and its scoring rubric, and responses keyed by respondent ID.

What is the identification score for respondent 8?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions with detailed descriptions and rubrics for scoring various aspects of session evaluations, such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and Comments. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended responses (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (e.g., Identification, Situation). The Identification field specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, scored from 0 to 3 based on completeness and prompting needed. The responses section lists individual respondent data with their respective answers to each question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions with detailed descriptions and rubrics for scoring various aspects of session evaluations, including identification, situation, background, assessment, recommendation, and global rating scale. Each respondent's answers are recorded with numeric scores or open-ended text corresponding to these questions. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 being not confident and 3 being very confident with little or no questioning. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID and their answers to each question. This structure allows for precise extraction of specific data points such as scores or session names for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scoring questions (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). Each rubric question has a defined scoring scale from 0 to 3, describing the level of performance or completeness. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question. The Identification score specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, with scores ranging from 0 (requires direct prompting) to 3 (complete introduction). The data allows for direct lookup of scores per respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 10?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based rating scales (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation, and Global Rating Scale). Each rubric question has a defined scoring system from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or confidence. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question. The Global Rating Scale measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, scored from 0 (Not at all confident) to 3 (Confident and required little or no questioning). The data allows for direct lookup of scores and open-ended responses per respondent.

What is the global rating score for respondent 3?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based rating scales for various aspects of the session such as Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. Each rubric is scored from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or confidence. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to these questions. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, scored from 0 (not confident) to 3 (very confident). This structure allows for detailed analysis of session quality and respondent performance.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 9?
</task>","The table contains session evaluation data where each respondent provides answers to questions about a medical session. The questions include open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based ratings for Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale indicating confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture. Each rubric score ranges from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance or confidence. The responses section lists individual respondent data with their answers to these questions.
