<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 17?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scoring questions (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). Each rubric question has a defined scoring scale from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or completeness. The responses section records individual respondent answers, identified by respondent ID, with their answers mapped to the corresponding questions. The Identification question specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, scored from 0 (requires prompting) to 3 (complete introduction). The data allows for direct lookup of scores or text answers per respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 17?
</task>","The table contains a questionnaire with questions about session details, identification, clinical assessment, and recommendations, each with specific rubrics or open-ended responses. The 'questions' section defines the meaning and scoring rubric for each question, including a Global Rating Scale (GRS) that measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture on a scale from 0 to 3. The 'responses' section records individual respondent answers, including numeric scores for rubric-based questions and text for open-ended ones. Respondent 17's data includes a Global Rating Scale score, which corresponds to the rubric defined in the questions. This structure allows precise interpretation of each response based on the schema.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 2?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to clinical session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scoring questions (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with scores ranging from 0 to 3 for rubric questions, indicating levels of performance or confidence. The Identification question specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, scored from 0 (requires prompting) to 3 (complete introduction). The responses section lists individual respondent data with their answers to each question. This structure allows for detailed analysis of each respondent's session performance based on standardized criteria.

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to clinical session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scoring questions (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with scores ranging from 0 to 3 for rubric questions indicating levels of performance or confidence. The Identification question specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, scored from 0 (requires prompting) to 3 (complete introduction). The responses section lists individual respondent data with their answers mapped to each question. This structure allows for detailed analysis of clinical session performance based on standardized criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</task>","The identification score measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, rated from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"" and 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete."" The responses section contains individual respondent data with their answers to each question, including the identification score. Respondent 5's identification score is recorded as ""0"" in the responses.

What is the session name for respondent 3?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions designed to evaluate various aspects of clinical sessions, including open-ended questions like the date and session name, and rubric-based questions assessing identification, situation recognition, history, examination, assessment, recommendations, and confidence levels. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with some answers being numeric rubric scores and others being open-ended text responses. The rubric scores have detailed descriptions in the schema, explaining the meaning of each numeric value. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers mapped to the question IDs. This structure allows for precise analysis of each respondent's session performance and feedback.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the date for respondent 15?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions like the date and session name, as well as rubric-based rating questions assessing identification, situation, background, assessment, recommendation, and confidence levels. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with responses either as text (for open-ended questions) or numeric scores (for rubric questions). The data is structured in XML format, with respondents identified by unique IDs. The schema defines the meaning and scoring criteria for each question, ensuring consistent interpretation of responses. This allows precise extraction of specific data points for each respondent.

What is the identification score for respondent 5?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to clinical session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scoring questions (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with scores indicating performance levels or confidence, where higher scores generally represent better or more complete responses. The Identification question specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and their role, scored from 0 to 3, with 0 meaning no introduction and 3 meaning a complete introduction. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers to each question. This structure allows for detailed analysis of each respondent’s session performance based on standardized criteria.

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scoring questions (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with scores ranging from 0 to 3 for rubric questions indicating levels of performance or confidence. The Identification question specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, scored from 0 (requires prompting) to 3 (complete introduction).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 20?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions designed to evaluate various aspects of clinical sessions, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based questions scored from 0 to 3 (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation, Global Rating Scale). Each respondent's answers are recorded under their unique respondent ID, with scores reflecting performance or confidence levels as defined in the question schema. The Global Rating Scale question measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, scored from 0 (Not at all confident) to 3 (Confident and required little or no questioning). Responses include both qualitative comments and quantitative rubric scores, allowing for comprehensive session evaluation.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 1?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions designed to evaluate various aspects of a session, including date, session name, identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation, global rating scale, and comments. Each question has a specific format, either open-ended or rubric-based with defined scoring criteria. The responses section records individual respondent answers mapped to these questions, with numeric scores for rubric questions and text for open-ended ones. The global rating scale question measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, scored from 0 to 3 with descriptive labels. Respondent data is identified by unique IDs, allowing precise extraction of specific answers.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 8?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scoring questions (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). Each rubric question has a defined scoring scale from 0 to 3, describing levels of performance or completeness. The responses section records individual respondent answers, linking each answer to a question by ID. Scores are numeric values representing performance levels as per the rubric descriptions. Open-ended responses provide qualitative feedback or session details.

What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based rating scales assessing various aspects of the session such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendations. Each rubric question uses a numeric scale from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or confidence, with detailed descriptions provided in the schema. The responses section records individual respondent answers, identified by respondent IDs, with their answers mapped to the corresponding questions. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, rated from 0 (Not at all confident) to 3 (Confident and required little or no questioning). This structure allows precise evaluation of each respondent's session performance and confidence levels.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the session name for respondent 18?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions like the date and session name, and rubric-based questions assessing identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation clarity, global rating scale, and comments. Each respondent's answers are recorded under their unique ID, with responses either as text (for open-ended questions) or numeric rubric scores (for assessment questions). The rubric scores range from 0 to 3 (or -1 in one case), indicating levels of performance or confidence. The session name is an open-ended field capturing the title or topic of the session. This structure allows for detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of each respondent's session.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 5?
</task>","Format specification and description:  
The dataset consists of a questionnaire with a defined schema describing each question's purpose and response type. The 'questions' section provides detailed descriptions and rubrics for each question, including open-ended and rubric-based answers. The 'responses' section contains individual respondent data identified by respondent IDs, with answers linked to question IDs. Each respondent's answers include session metadata (e.g., date, session name) and scored evaluations based on the rubric. This structure allows precise extraction of specific data points for each respondent.

What is the session name for respondent 1?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions like the date and session name, and rubric-based questions assessing identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation clarity, global rating scale, and comments. Each respondent's answers are recorded under their unique ID, with responses either as text for open-ended questions or numeric scores for rubric questions. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3 (with some exceptions like -1), indicating levels of performance or confidence. The session name is an open-ended field capturing the title or topic of the session. This structure allows for detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of each session.

What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based rating scales assessing various aspects of the session such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendations. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with ratings typically ranging from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or confidence. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, with 0 meaning not confident and 3 meaning confident with little or no questioning.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The identification score measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, rated from 0 to 3, where 0 means requiring direct prompting and 3 means complete introduction without prompting. The responses section contains individual respondent data with their answers to each question, including the identification score. Respondent 1's identification score is recorded under the ""Identification"" question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the date for respondent 3?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to session evaluations, including open-ended questions like the date and session name, and rubric-based questions assessing various aspects of the session such as identification, situation, background, assessment, recommendation, and confidence levels. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with some answers being numeric rubric scores and others being textual responses. The rubric scores have defined meanings in the questions section, indicating levels of performance or confidence. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, each with their corresponding answers to the questions. This structure allows for detailed analysis of session quality and respondent performance.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 23?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions with detailed descriptions and rubrics for scoring various aspects of a session, such as identification, situation, background, assessment, recommendation, and comments. Each respondent's answers are recorded with their respondent ID, including open-ended responses (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (e.g., Identification, Situation). The Identification question measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides complete information, scored from 0 to 3. The responses section lists individual respondent data with their answers mapped to the question IDs. This structure allows precise extraction of specific scores or text answers for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The table contains a questionnaire with questions about session details and performance ratings, including open-ended and rubric-based questions. Each respondent provides answers to questions such as the date of the session, session name, identification quality, problem identification, history and examination appropriateness, assessment logic, recommendation clarity, confidence in the assessment, and additional comments. The rubric questions use a 0-3 scale to rate performance aspects, while some questions are open-ended text responses. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID with their corresponding answers. This structure allows for detailed evaluation of each session's quality and content.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the session name for respondent 14?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to clinical session evaluations, including open-ended questions like the date and session name, and rubric-based questions assessing various aspects of the session such as identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation clarity, and a global rating scale. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with some answers being numeric rubric scores and others being text responses. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or confidence. Comments are open-ended text fields providing qualitative feedback. The data is structured in XML format with respondents identified by unique IDs.

What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to clinical session evaluations, including open-ended questions like ""Date,"" ""SessionName,"" and ""Comments,"" as well as rubric-based rating questions assessing identification, situation recognition, history, examination, assessment, recommendation clarity, and confidence in the global rating scale. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with responses identified by respondent ID. The rubric questions use a numeric scale from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or confidence. The ""SessionName"" field is an open-ended text response specifying the name or type of the clinical session. This structure allows for detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of each respondent's session.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the date for respondent 16?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions related to clinical session evaluations, including open-ended questions like the date and session name, as well as rubric-based rating questions assessing identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation clarity, and confidence in the global rating scale. Each respondent provides answers to these questions, with responses identified by respondent ID. The rubric questions use numeric scores to indicate levels of performance or confidence, while open-ended questions capture textual data. Comments provide qualitative feedback on the session. This structure allows for detailed analysis of each respondent's clinical session performance and communication.
