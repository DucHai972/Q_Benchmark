<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","The table contains session evaluation data where each respondent is scored on various clinical competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is rated on a rubric scale from 0 to 3, indicating the level of performance or confidence. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field specifically measures how clearly the respondent makes a recommendation, with 2 indicating a clear recommendation after minimal questioning. The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores and comments. This structure allows for identifying respondents who meet specific performance criteria based on rubric scores.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The table contains session evaluation data where each respondent is scored on various clinical competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is rated on a rubric scale from 0 to 3, indicating the level of performance or confidence. The Assessment field specifically measures the logical clinical assessment ability, with 2 indicating assessment after minimal questioning. The responses section lists individual respondent scores for each question. The goal is to identify which respondent has an Assessment score of 2, indicating a good clinical assessment.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions with detailed rubrics explaining the scoring criteria for each clinical skill or assessment area, such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each respondent's answers are recorded with numerical scores corresponding to these rubrics, along with open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments. The ""Situation"" field specifically measures the ability to identify the main problem(s) with scores ranging from 0 (unable) to 3 (unprompted identification and prioritization). The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores for each question. This structure allows for precise evaluation of clinical competencies based on the rubric definitions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The table contains responses from multiple respondents evaluated on various clinical skills during sessions. Each respondent's answers include dates, session names, and scores for identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation, and a global rating scale. Scores range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance according to detailed rubrics. The ""Assessment"" field specifically measures the logical clinical assessment ability, with 2 indicating assessment after minimal questioning.

Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions with detailed rubrics explaining the scoring criteria for each clinical skill or assessment area, such as Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each respondent's answers are recorded with numerical scores corresponding to these rubrics, along with open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments. The Background (history) field specifically measures the relevance and structure of the patient's history provided, scored from 0 (unstructured or non-relevant) to 3 (comprehensive focused history). The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores for each question.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions with detailed rubrics explaining the scoring criteria for each clinical skill or assessment area, such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each respondent's answers are recorded with numerical scores corresponding to these rubrics, along with open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments. The Situation field specifically measures the ability to identify the main problem(s), scored from 0 (unable) to 3 (identifies and prioritizes unprompted). The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores for each question. This structure allows for precise evaluation of clinical performance based on standardized criteria.

Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The table contains session evaluation data where each respondent is scored on various clinical competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is rated on a rubric scale from 0 to 3, indicating the level of performance or confidence. The ""Assessment"" field specifically measures the logical clinical assessment ability, with 2 indicating assessment after minimal questioning. The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores and comments. This structure allows identification of respondents meeting specific score criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains responses from multiple respondents to a clinical session questionnaire. Each respondent's answers include session metadata (Date, SessionName), and scored rubric items such as Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). The Identification field measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and their role, scored from 0 (requires direct prompting) to 3 (complete introduction). Scores are numeric and correspond to defined rubric levels. Comments provide qualitative feedback.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The table contains session evaluation data where each respondent is scored on various clinical competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is rated on a rubric scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance or confidence. The ""Situation"" field specifically measures the ability to identify the main problem(s), with a score of 2 meaning the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed. The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores and comments. This structure allows for direct comparison of respondents based on their rubric scores.

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The table contains a set of questions with detailed rubrics explaining the scoring criteria for each clinical skill or assessment area, such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each respondent's answers are recorded with numerical scores corresponding to these rubrics, along with open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments. Scores range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance or confidence, except for one instance of -1 indicating omitted or irrelevant observations. The ""Situation"" field specifically measures the ability to identify the main problem(s), with a score of 2 meaning the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The table contains responses from multiple respondents evaluated on various clinical session criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each criterion is scored based on a rubric provided in the questions section, where scores range from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or completeness. Identification specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, with 0 indicating the need for direct prompting. The responses section lists individual respondent scores for each criterion along with session details and comments. This structure allows for straightforward comparison of respondent performance on specific criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good identification score (2)?
</task>","The table contains responses from multiple respondents evaluated on various clinical session criteria. Each respondent's answers include dates, session names, and rubric-based scores for identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation, and a global rating scale. The identification score rubric ranges from 0 to 3, indicating the completeness and spontaneity of self-introduction. The data allows comparison of respondents based on these rubric scores. Comments provide qualitative feedback on each session.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The table contains responses from multiple respondents evaluated on various clinical session criteria, including identification, situation, background history, background examination, assessment, recommendation, and global rating scale. Each criterion is scored based on a rubric that ranges from 0 to 3, indicating the quality or completeness of the response. The ""Background (examination)"" field specifically measures the appropriateness and clarity of examination or observations, with 1 indicating ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed."" The responses include both numerical scores and open-ended comments for qualitative insights. This structured data allows for precise identification of respondents meeting specific score criteria.

Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains responses from multiple respondents to a clinical session questionnaire. Each respondent's answers include the date and name of the session, and scores for various clinical competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, where 0 generally indicates poor or no performance and 3 indicates complete or comprehensive performance. Comments provide qualitative feedback on the session. The Identification field specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The table contains session evaluation data where each respondent is scored on various clinical and communication skills based on a rubric. The key fields include Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale, each scored from 0 to 3 with specific criteria. Identification measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and their role, with 0 indicating the need for direct prompting. The responses section lists individual respondent scores and comments for each session. This structure allows for precise assessment of clinical communication and reasoning skills.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The table contains session evaluation data with questions assessing various clinical competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, where 0 generally indicates poor or no performance and 3 indicates complete or comprehensive performance. The Identification question specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and their role, with 0 meaning they require direct prompting. The responses section lists individual respondents with their scores for each question and additional comments. This structure allows for straightforward comparison of respondent performance across multiple clinical skills.
