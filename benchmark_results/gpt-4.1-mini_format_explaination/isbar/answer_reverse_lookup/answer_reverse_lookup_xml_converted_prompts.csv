<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains responses from multiple respondents to a clinical session questionnaire. Each respondent's answers include session metadata (Date, SessionName), and rubric-scored assessments across several clinical competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. The Recommendation (clear recommendation) field is scored from 0 to 3, indicating the clarity and independence of the recommendation made. The data allows comparison of respondents based on these rubric scores. Comments provide qualitative feedback but are not scored.

Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains a questionnaire with multiple questions assessing clinical session performance. Each question has a rubric explaining the scoring system, where higher scores indicate better performance or confidence. Respondents provide answers to these questions, including identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation, and global rating scale. The ""Assessment"" question measures the logical clinical assessment quality, scored from 0 to 3, with 2 indicating assessment after minimal questioning. The responses section lists individual respondent IDs with their respective scores for each question.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

</task>","The table contains questions that assess various aspects of clinical sessions, including identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation, and a global rating scale. Each question has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3 indicating the quality or completeness of the response. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question, including numeric rubric scores and open-ended comments. The ""Assessment"" question specifically measures the logical assessment quality, with a score of 2 indicating an assessment after minimal questioning.

</task>","The table contains a set of questions with detailed rubrics describing the scoring criteria for each clinical skill or assessment area, such as Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. Each respondent's answers are recorded with numeric scores corresponding to these rubrics, along with open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments. The Background (examination) question specifically measures the quality and completeness of clinical observations, scored from 0 (omitted or irrelevant) to 3 (comprehensive focused examination/observations).

Which respondent has a good background examination score (2)?
</task>","Specification and description of the table:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a defined rubric explaining the scoring system. The key questions include Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale), each scored from 0 to 3 based on the quality and completeness of the response. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers to each question recorded as numeric scores or open-ended text. The ""Background (examination)"" question specifically assesses the appropriateness and completeness of examination/observations, scored from 0 (omitted or irrelevant) to 3 (comprehensive focused examination/observations). The task is to identify which respondent(s) scored exactly 2 on the ""Background (examination)"" question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a rubric explaining the scoring system. The key question of interest is ""Background (examination),"" which is scored from 0 to 3, where 1 means ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed."" The responses section lists multiple respondents with their answers to each question, including their scores for ""Background (examination)."" The task is to identify which respondent has a score of 1 for this question, indicating a moderate level of performance.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a defined rubric explaining the scoring system. The key question ""Situation"" assesses the respondent's ability to identify the main problem(s) with scores ranging from 0 (unable) to 3 (identifies and prioritizes unprompted). The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question, including the ""Situation"" score. The task is to identify respondents who scored exactly 2 on the ""Situation"" question, meaning they identified the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","Specification and description of the table:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a specific rubric or open-ended format. The key questions include Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with defined meanings. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers to each question recorded as numeric scores or text. The Background (examination) question specifically measures the appropriateness and clarity of examination/observations, with a score of 1 indicating ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed."" The task is to identify which respondent has a Background (examination) score of 1, indicating a moderate level of performance in that area.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a defined rubric or open-ended format. The key questions include Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with specific meanings. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers to each question recorded as numeric scores or text. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" question measures how clear the recommendation was, with 1 indicating ""Clear recommendation only after extended questioning."" The data allows analysis of respondents' performance based on these rubric scores.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Specification and description of the table:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a specific rubric or open-ended format. The key questions include Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with defined meanings. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers to each question recorded as numeric scores or text. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" question measures how clear the recommendation was, with 1 indicating ""Clear recommendation only after extended questioning."" The data allows comparison of respondents based on these rubric scores.

The Background (examination) question specifically assesses the appropriateness and completeness of examination/observations, with a score of 1 indicating ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed."" The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores for each question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions assessing clinical session performance, including identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation, and confidence levels. Each question has a rubric explaining the scoring criteria, mostly ranging from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question, including numeric scores and open-ended comments. The ""Identification"" question specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, with 0 indicating ""Requires direct prompting."" The task is to identify which respondent scored 0 on the Identification question.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains responses to a clinical session questionnaire. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about the session date, session name, and various clinical assessment criteria scored on rubrics from 0 to 3. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" question measures how clear the respondent's recommendation was, with scores from 0 (No recommendation) to 3 (Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning). The data includes both rubric-based scores and open-ended comments. This structure allows evaluation of clinical performance and communication clarity.

The table contains a questionnaire with multiple questions assessing clinical session performance. Each question has a rubric explaining the scoring system, where higher scores indicate better performance or more completeness. Respondents provide answers to these questions, including identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation, and global rating scale. Scores range from 0 to 3, with 2 indicating a moderate level of competence or completeness. The ""Situation"" question specifically measures the ability to identify the main problem(s), with a score of 2 meaning the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","Specification and description of the table:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a specific rubric or open-ended format. The key questions include Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with defined meanings. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers to each question recorded as numeric scores or text. The Background (examination) question specifically measures the appropriateness and clarity of examination/observations, scored from 0 (omitted or irrelevant) to 3 (comprehensive focused examination/observations). The task is to identify which respondent has a Background (examination) score of 1, indicating observations reported but frequent clarification needed.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains responses from multiple respondents to a clinical session questionnaire. Each respondent's answers include session metadata (Date, SessionName), and rubric-based scores for various clinical skills such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. Scores range from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating the poorest performance and 3 the best, as defined in the questions schema. Comments provide qualitative feedback. The Identification question specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and identifies their role and patient, with 0 meaning ""Requires direct prompting.""

Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains responses to a clinical session questionnaire. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about their session, including date, session name, and various rubric-scored clinical skills such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. The Identification question is scored from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting."" The data allows evaluation of respondents' clinical performance based on these rubric scores. Comments provide qualitative feedback on each session.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Specification and description of the table:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a specific rubric or open-ended format. The key questions include Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 with defined meanings. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers to each question recorded as numeric scores or text. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" question measures how clear the recommendation was, with 1 indicating ""Clear recommendation only after extended questioning."" The data allows analysis of respondents' performance based on these rubric scores.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Specification and description of the table:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a specific rubric or open-ended format. The key questions include Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 based on the rubric provided. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers to each question recorded. Scores reflect the quality or completeness of the clinical session elements, with higher scores indicating better performance or confidence. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" question specifically measures how clear and confident the recommendation was, with 1 indicating a clear recommendation only after extended questioning.

Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The table contains a questionnaire with multiple questions assessing clinical session performance, including identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation, and global rating scale. Each question has a rubric explaining the scoring criteria from 0 to 3, where 0 generally indicates poor or no performance and 3 indicates complete or comprehensive performance. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question, including numeric scores and open-ended comments. The identification question specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, with 0 meaning ""Requires direct prompting.""

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The table contains a questionnaire with multiple questions assessing clinical session performance, including identification, situation, background history and examination, assessment, recommendation, and confidence levels. Each question has a rubric explaining the scoring criteria from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance or completeness. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question, including numeric rubric scores and open-ended comments. The ""Background (history)"" question specifically measures the relevance and structure of the patient's history provided, scored from 0 (unstructured or non-relevant) to 3 (comprehensive focused history). The task is to identify respondents who scored exactly 2 on the ""Background (history)"" question.

Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains a questionnaire with multiple questions assessing clinical session performance. Each question has a rubric explaining the scoring system, where higher scores indicate better performance or more completeness. Respondents provide answers to these questions, including identification, situation, background history, background examination, assessment, recommendation, and comments. The ""Background (history)"" question evaluates the relevance and structure of the patient's history given by the respondent, scored from 0 (unstructured or non-relevant) to 3 (comprehensive focused history). The responses section lists individual respondent IDs with their respective scores for each question.

The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions assessing clinical session performance, including identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation, and confidence levels. Each question has a rubric explaining the scoring system from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance or completeness. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question, including numeric rubric scores and open-ended comments. The ""Background (examination)"" question specifically measures the appropriateness and quality of examination/observations, with a score of 1 indicating ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed."" The task is to identify which respondent has a score of 1 for this ""Background (examination)"" question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</task>","Specification and description of the table:  
The dataset contains a questionnaire with multiple questions, each having a specific rubric or open-ended format. The key questions include Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale, each scored from 0 to 3 based on the rubric provided. The responses section lists individual respondents by ID, with their answers to each question recorded as numeric scores or text. The ""Background (history)"" question assesses the relevance and structure of the patient's history provided, scored from 0 (unstructured or non-relevant) to 3 (comprehensive focused history). The task is to identify respondents who scored 2 on the ""Background (history)"" question, meaning they gave relevant history with few further questions needed.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains responses to a clinical session questionnaire. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers to questions about their session, including date, session name, and various rubric-scored clinical skills such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a global rating scale. The Identification question is scored from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting."" The data allows evaluation of clinical performance based on these rubric scores.
