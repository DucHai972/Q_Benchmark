<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based scoring for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance. The Recommendation section includes two fields: ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" and ""Recommendation (global rating scale),"" both scored similarly. Responses are provided for multiple respondents, each with their respective scores and comments. The data allows comparison of respondents based on their rubric scores for specific competencies.

Respondents with a recommendation score of 2 (good recommendation) in ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" are: 16",True

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based scoring for various clinical competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance or confidence. The responses section lists individual respondents with their scores for each competency and additional comments. The ""Assessment"" field specifically measures the logical assessment ability, with a score of 2 indicating assessment after minimal questioning.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based scoring for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. Each competency is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance or confidence. The Assessment field specifically measures the logical assessment ability, with 2 indicating assessment after minimal questioning. Responses are provided per respondent, including their scores and comments. This structure allows comparison of respondents based on their rubric scores for clinical skills.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based scoring for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with descriptions provided for each score level. The responses section lists individual respondents with their scores for each competency and additional comments. Scores can be negative, indicating missing or invalid data. The Background (examination) field specifically measures the appropriateness and clarity of examination/observations, with 1 indicating observations reported but frequent clarification needed.

Respondent 23 has a Background (examination) score of 1.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based ratings for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. Each competency is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance or confidence. The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores and comments. The ""Situation"" field specifically measures the ability to identify the main problem(s), with a score of 2 meaning ""Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.""

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based scoring for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is scored on a scale, with detailed rubric descriptions provided for interpretation. The responses section lists individual respondents with their scores and comments. Scores range from negative values (indicating missing or irrelevant data) to 3 (highest performance). The Identification score specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides complete information.

Respondent 5 has a poor identification score of 0.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from multiple respondents about clinical sessions. Each respondent's data includes the session date, session name, and scores for various clinical communication and assessment criteria. Scores are based on rubrics ranging from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance or confidence. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field measures how clearly the respondent made a recommendation, with 1 indicating a clear recommendation only after extended questioning. Comments provide qualitative feedback on the session. This structure allows evaluation of respondents' clinical communication and assessment skills.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session performance, including identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation, and confidence ratings. Each question has a rubric defining score meanings from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance or completeness. The responses section lists individual respondents with their scores for each question and comments. The ""Background (history)"" field measures the appropriateness and relevance of the patient's history given, with a score of 2 meaning ""Relevant history with few further questions needed.""

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session performance, including identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation, and confidence ratings. Each question has a rubric explaining the scoring scale from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance or confidence. The responses section lists individual respondents with their scores for each question and comments. The ""Background (examination)"" field measures the appropriateness and completeness of examination/observations, scored from 0 (omitted or irrelevant) to 3 (comprehensive focused examination). The task is to identify the respondent with a moderate background examination score of 1.

Respondent 4 has a background examination score of 1.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based scoring for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendations. Each competency is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with detailed descriptions provided in the schema for each score level. The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores and comments. The ""Background (examination)"" field specifically measures the appropriateness and completeness of examination/observations, scored from 0 (omitted or irrelevant) to 3 (comprehensive focused examination). The task is to identify the respondent(s) with a ""moderate"" background examination score, which corresponds to a score of 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions and responses from multiple respondents. Each question has a specific rubric or open-ended format, detailing how responses are scored or recorded. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question, including numeric scores for rubric-based questions and text for open-ended ones. The identification question measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, scored from 0 (requires direct prompting) to 3 (complete introduction). This structure allows for clear comparison of respondent performance across various clinical communication and assessment criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based ratings for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 generally indicates poor or no performance and 3 indicates complete or comprehensive performance. The responses section lists individual respondents with their scores for each competency and additional comments. The Identification field specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides information about their role and patient. The data allows comparison of respondents based on these rubric scores.

Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from multiple respondents about clinical sessions. Each respondent's data includes the session date, session name, and scores for various clinical communication and assessment criteria. Scores are based on rubrics ranging from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance or confidence. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field measures how clearly the respondent made a recommendation, with 1 indicating a clear recommendation only after extended questioning. Comments provide qualitative feedback on the session.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based ratings for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 generally indicates poor or no performance and 3 indicates complete or comprehensive performance. The responses section lists individual respondents with their scores for each competency and additional comments. Identification specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides role and patient information, with 0 meaning ""Requires direct prompting.""

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about clinical session details and rubric-based ratings for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each competency is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 generally indicates poor or no performance and 3 indicates complete or comprehensive performance. The responses section lists individual respondents with their scores for each competency and additional comments. The Identification field specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides relevant information, with 0 meaning ""Requires direct prompting."" The data includes three respondents with their respective scores.

Respondent 5 has a poor identification score of 0.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from multiple respondents about clinical sessions. Each respondent's data includes the session date, session name, and scores for various clinical communication and assessment criteria. Scores are based on rubrics defined in the questions section, such as Identification (0 to 3), Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a global rating scale. Identification score measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides information about their role and patient. Comments are open-ended text fields providing additional qualitative feedback.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from multiple respondents about clinical sessions. Each respondent's data includes the session date, session name, and scores for various clinical communication and assessment criteria. Scores range from 0 to 3, with 0 generally indicating poor or no performance and 3 indicating excellent performance. The ""Identification"" field measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and provides information about their role and patient, with 0 meaning ""Requires direct prompting."" Comments are open-ended text fields providing qualitative feedback.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
