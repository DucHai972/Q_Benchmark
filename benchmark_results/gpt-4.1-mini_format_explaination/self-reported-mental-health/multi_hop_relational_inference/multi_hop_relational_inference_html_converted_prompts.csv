<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Socio-economic status score of 1 and Ethnic identity score of 6?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple respondents, each identified by a unique respondent number. Each respondent's data includes demographic information such as Year of birth, Gender, Socio-economic status, and Ethnic identity, along with various Likert-scale measures related to life satisfaction, happiness, emotional regulation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The Socio-economic status is rated on a scale from 1 (Very low) to 6 (Very high), and Ethnic identity is a multiple-choice question with six possible categories. The data is structured in nested HTML lists, with some fields having subfields (e.g., Parental Education for Father and Mother). This structure allows for detailed analysis of individual respondent characteristics and emotional states.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
