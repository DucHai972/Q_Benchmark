<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","Specification and description of the table:  
The dataset contains survey responses from clinicians identified by respondent numbers. Each respondent belongs to a group classified as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey uses Likert scales (1 to 5) to measure various perceptions about a system, including frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and confidence in use. The ""Frequent_Usage"" field indicates how much the respondent would like to use the system frequently, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree. The responses section lists individual answers for each respondent, including their ratings for all questions.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data where each respondent provides answers to various questions about their experience with a system. The questions include open-ended fields like ""Name"" and multiple-choice fields such as ""Group"" with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Most questions use a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) to rate different aspects like ease of use, system complexity, and confidence in use. Each response entry includes a respondent number and their answers to all questions. This structure allows for analysis of individual and group perceptions of the system.

Which respondent numbers have ease of learning ratings equal to 4?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians identified by respondent numbers. Each respondent's answers include demographic information such as their group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern) and various Likert scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability aspects like ease of use, system complexity, and ease of learning. The ""Ease_of_Learning"" field measures how quickly respondents think most people would learn to use the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data where each respondent provides answers to various questions about their experience with a system. The questions include open-ended fields like ""Name"" and multiple-choice groups such as ""Group"" with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Most questions use a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) to rate different aspects like system complexity, ease of use, and confidence in use. Each response is identified by a unique respondent number and includes their answers mapped to the schema. This structure allows for analysis of individual ratings and group categorizations.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scale questions (1 to 5) and categorical groupings. Each respondent is identified by a unique respondent number and provides answers to questions about system usability, complexity, and confidence. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The ""Ease_of_Use"" question measures how easy the system was to use, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of respondents based on their ratings and group classifications.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings greater than 3?
</task>","The table contains survey data from respondents evaluating a system using various Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) and categorical groupings. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and provides answers to questions about system usage frequency, complexity, ease of use, and other usability factors. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. Likert-scale responses range from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings less than 3?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using various Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) and categorical data. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and provides answers to questions about system usability, complexity, and confidence. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The ""Ease_of_Use"" question measures how easy the system was to use, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of user experience based on these structured responses.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings greater than or equal to 4 and ease of use ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scales (1–5) for various usability aspects. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and provides answers to questions such as system complexity and ease of use. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The Likert scale values indicate levels of agreement or disagreement with statements about the system. This structured data allows analysis of user perceptions based on their ratings.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have integration of functions ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians, each identified by a respondent number. Each respondent's answers include demographic information such as their group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern) and various Likert-scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability aspects like ease of use, system complexity, and integration of functions. The ""Integration_of_Functions"" field measures how well respondents felt the system's functions were integrated, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of individual ratings to identify specific respondents meeting certain criteria. This structure supports detailed usability and user experience evaluation.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians, each identified by a respondent number. Each respondent's answers include demographic information such as their group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern) and various Likert scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability aspects like ease of use, system complexity, and need for technical support. The ""Need for Technical Support"" field measures the respondent's agreement with needing technical help to use the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of individual responses to identify patterns or specific ratings. This structured format supports precise querying of respondent ratings.

Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings less than or equal to 4?
</task>","The table contains survey data where each respondent has answered multiple questions about their experience with a system. The questions include open-ended fields like ""Name"" and multiple-choice groups such as ""Group"" with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Most questions use a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) to rate various aspects like ease of use, system complexity, and confidence in use. Each response entry includes a respondent number and their answers to all questions. This structure allows analysis of user feedback based on specific criteria such as ease of use ratings.

The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. Likert-scale questions use a 1–5 scale, where 1 typically indicates strong disagreement and 5 strong agreement. The data allows analysis of specific ratings, such as frequent usage, ease of use, and system complexity.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings equal to 2?
</task>","The table contains survey data from respondents who rated various aspects of a system using Likert scales from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. Each respondent is identified by a unique respondent number and provides answers to questions about system complexity, ease of use, confidence, and other usability factors. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern groups. The data includes both open-ended responses (Name) and multiple-choice coded responses (Group). The focus is on numeric ratings for system attributes, allowing analysis of user perceptions.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings greater than 3?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians, each identified by a respondent number. Each respondent belongs to a group classified as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey uses Likert scales (1 to 5) to measure various perceptions about a system, including ease of use, system complexity, and confidence in use. The ""Ease_of_Use"" field specifically captures how easy the respondent found the system to use, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. The data allows comparison of these ratings across respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings less than or equal to 3?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians identified by respondent numbers. Each respondent belongs to a group classified as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey uses Likert scales (1 to 5) to measure various perceptions about a system, such as ease of use, system complexity, and confidence in use. The ""Confidence_in_Use"" field specifically captures how confident the respondent felt using the system, with 1 being strongly disagree and 5 strongly agree. The data allows analysis of individual ratings across these dimensions.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have cumbersome to use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using various Likert scale questions (1 to 5) and multiple-choice group classifications. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and provides answers to questions about system usability, complexity, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The Likert scale responses measure agreement levels, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. This structured data allows analysis of user perceptions and experiences with the system.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings greater than 2?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using various Likert scale questions (1 to 5) and categorical data. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and provides answers to questions about system usability, complexity, and support needs. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. Likert scale questions measure agreement levels, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The ""Need for Technical Support"" question assesses whether respondents feel they require technical help to use the system.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scale questions (1 to 5) and categorical groupings. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and provides answers to questions about system usability, complexity, and confidence in use. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The ""Confidence_in_Use"" question measures how confident respondents felt using the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of individual ratings and group characteristics.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scales (1 to 5) and multiple-choice groups. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and provides answers to questions about system usability, complexity, and confidence. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The ""Ease_of_Use"" question measures how easy the system was to use, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of respondents' perceptions based on their ratings.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings greater than or equal to 3?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Each respondent is identified by a unique respondent number and provides answers to questions about system complexity, ease of use, technical support needs, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern groups. The ""Inconsistency"" question measures the perceived inconsistency in the system on a scale from 1 to 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings less than or equal to 1?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using various Likert scale questions (1 to 5) and categorical data. Each respondent is identified by a unique respondent number and provides answers to questions about system usability, complexity, and confidence. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. Likert scale questions measure agreement levels, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The data allows analysis of specific ratings such as inconsistency in the system.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings equal to 2?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple clinicians, each identified by a respondent number. Each respondent's answers include demographic information such as their group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern) and various Likert scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability aspects like ease of use, system complexity, and need for technical support. The ""Need for Technical Support"" field measures the respondent's agreement with needing technical help to use the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of individual responses based on these ratings. This structure supports identifying respondents based on specific rating criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scale questions (1 to 5) and categorical groupings. Each respondent is identified by a unique respondent number and provides answers to questions about system usability, complexity, and confidence. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The ""Ease_of_Use"" question measures how easy the system was to use, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of respondents' perceptions based on their ratings.

Answer: 23, 70",True
