<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the need to learn before use score for Clinician 53?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians, where each respondent is identified by a unique ID and name. Each respondent's group is categorized as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern, indicated by letter codes mapped to these categories. The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) assessing various aspects of system usability and user experience. The ""Need to Learn Before Use"" question measures how much learning was required before using the system, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. The data allows mapping coded responses to descriptive text or numeric scores as appropriate.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians, including their names, group classifications, and responses to various Likert-scale questions about system usage and usability. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and associated with a group category (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The Likert-scale questions measure attitudes such as frequency of system use, perceived complexity, ease of use, and confidence. The data schema clearly defines the meaning and scale of each question, ensuring consistent interpretation. Responses are recorded as text or numeric values corresponding to the schema.

The ""Cumbersome to Use"" question specifically measures how awkward the respondent found the system to use, on the same 1–5 scale. The data is structured in RDF format with predicates linking respondents to their answers.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

What is the inconsistency score for Clinician 36?
</task>","The table contains survey questions and responses from clinicians. Each question is described with its text and response type, including multiple-choice questions (MCQ) and Likert scale ratings from 1 to 5. The responses section lists individual clinicians with their answers to each question, including group membership and various Likert scale scores. The inconsistency score is a Likert rating indicating the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The data is structured using RDF-like triples with predicates linking respondents to their answers.

What is the integration of functions score for Clinician 55?
</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians, including their names, group classifications, and responses to various Likert-scale questions about system usability and complexity. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and associated with a group category (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The questions section defines the meaning of each field and the scale used for responses, such as frequency of use and perceived system complexity. The responses section provides individual scores for each question per clinician. The ""Integration of Functions"" score reflects how well the respondent felt the system's functions were integrated, rated on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the system complexity score for Clinician 83?
</task>","The table contains survey data where each respondent is identified by a unique ID and name. Each respondent belongs to a group categorized as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) assessing various aspects of system usability and user experience. The ""System Complexity"" question measures how complex the respondent found the system, with 1 indicating ""Strongly Disagree"" (not complex) and 5 indicating ""Strongly Agree"" (very complex). The responses section provides individual scores for each question per respondent.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the need to learn before use score for Clinician 72?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions and responses from clinicians. Each question is defined with a description and, for some, multiple-choice options with letter codes. The responses section lists individual clinicians with their answers, including group membership and Likert scale scores (1–5) for various usability aspects. The ""Need to Learn Before Use"" question measures how much learning was required before using the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows mapping codes to descriptive text for MCQ fields and direct numeric values for Likert scale responses.

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
What is the confidence in use score for Clinician 42?
</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians, including their names, group classifications, and responses to various Likert-scale questions about system usability and experience. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and associated with a group category (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The Likert-scale questions measure agreement levels from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) on different aspects such as ease of use, system complexity, and confidence in use. The data is structured with predicates linking respondents to their answers. This allows for precise extraction of individual responses based on clinician name.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the confidence in use score for Clinician 80?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians, where each respondent is identified by a unique ID and name. The questions include demographic information such as the group of the respondent, and various Likert-scale items measuring perceptions of system usability and complexity. Each Likert-scale question is scored from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data captures individual responses to these questions, allowing analysis of user experience and confidence with the system. The ""Confidence in Use"" question specifically measures how confident the respondent felt using the system, rated on the 1–5 scale.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the ease of use score for Clinician 29?
</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians, including their names, group classifications, and responses to various Likert-scale questions about system usability and complexity. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and associated with a group category (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The Likert-scale questions measure agreement levels from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) on statements related to system usage, ease, and confidence. The data schema defines the meaning of each question and the response format. This structured format allows for precise extraction of individual responses based on clinician names.

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the ease of use score for Clinician 60?
</task>","The table contains survey questions and responses from clinicians about their experience using a system. Each question is defined with a description and response type, such as open-ended or multiple-choice with Likert scale ratings from 1 to 5. Respondents are identified by unique IDs and names, with their answers recorded for each question. The ""Ease of Use"" question asks respondents to rate how easy they found the system to use on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The responses section provides the actual scores given by each clinician.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the need for technical support score for Clinician 22?
</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians, including their names, group classifications, and responses to various Likert-scale questions about system usability and complexity. Each question is defined with a description and response format, such as multiple-choice groups or Likert scales from 1 to 5. The responses section lists individual clinicians with their answers mapped to the corresponding predicates. The ""Need for Technical Support"" question measures the extent to which a respondent feels they require technical assistance, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). This structured format allows precise extraction of individual scores for specific questions.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the integration of functions score for Clinician 9?
</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians, including their names, group classifications, and responses to various Likert-scale questions about system usability and complexity. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and has associated attributes such as group membership (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern) and scores from 1 to 5 indicating their level of agreement with specific statements. The questions section defines the meaning of each field and the scale used for responses. The responses section provides individual data points for each clinician. This structure allows for precise mapping of coded responses to their descriptive meanings.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the need for technical support score for Clinician 32?
</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians, including their names, group classifications, and responses to various Likert-scale questions about system usability and complexity. Each question is defined with a description and response scale, such as multiple-choice groups or 1–5 Likert scores. The responses section lists individual clinicians with their answers mapped to the corresponding predicates. The ""Need for Technical Support"" question measures the extent to which a respondent feels they require technical help, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). This structured format allows precise extraction of individual scores for specific questions.

What is the cumbersome to use score for Clinician 8?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians, where each respondent is identified by a unique ID and name. The questions include both open-ended and multiple-choice formats, with Likert scale ratings from 1 to 5 for various usability aspects of a system. The ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern, coded as A, B, C, and D respectively. Each respondent's answers to the questions are recorded as literal values or codes corresponding to the schema. This structured data allows for precise analysis of individual responses based on the defined question meanings.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the need for technical support score for Clinician 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians, where each respondent is identified by a unique ID and name. The questions include demographic information such as the group of the respondent (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern) and various Likert-scale items measuring perceptions of system usability and complexity. Each response records scores from 1 to 5, where 1 typically means strong disagreement and 5 strong agreement. The ""Need for Technical Support"" question specifically asks how much support a respondent thinks they would need to use the system, rated on this Likert scale. The data allows mapping coded group letters to descriptive group names and provides detailed individual responses.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the need to learn before use score for Clinician 14?
</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians, including their names, group classifications, and responses to various Likert-scale questions about system usability and complexity. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and associated with a group category (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The Likert-scale questions measure agreement levels from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) on different aspects of system use. The ""Need to Learn Before Use"" question assesses how much learning was required before using the system. The data is structured with predicates linking respondents to their answers.
