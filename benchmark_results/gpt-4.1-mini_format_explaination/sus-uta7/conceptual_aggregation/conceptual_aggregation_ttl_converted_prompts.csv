</task>","Specification and description:  
The dataset consists of survey responses from individuals identified as persons. Each respondent has a name and belongs to a group categorized as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), including Ease_of_Use, which measures how easy the respondent found the system to use. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to these questions. The data allows analysis of respondents' perceptions based on their group and ratings.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have Integration_of_Functions 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple respondents, each identified as a Person with a unique Respondent ID. Each respondent's data includes their name, group classification (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and answers to various Likert-scale questions about system usability and experience. The Integration_of_Functions field measures how well respondents felt the system's functions were integrated, rated on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of respondents' perceptions and group distributions based on their answers.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have Cumbersome_to_Use 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about respondents' demographics and their opinions on system usability, measured on Likert scales from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The key MCQ field is ""Group of the respondent,"" with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent is identified by an ID and name, with their answers recorded for each question. The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" field measures how awkward the system is to use, with 1 indicating ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., not cumbersome). The responses section lists three respondents with their respective answers.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have Ease_of_Learning 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions describing respondent attributes and their answers on various Likert scale items. Each respondent is identified by an ID and has attributes such as Name, Group, and responses to questions about system usage and perceptions. The Group field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The Ease_of_Learning field measures how quickly respondents think most people would learn to use the system, rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to these questions.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have Frequent_Usage 5?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual respondents identified as persons. Each respondent has a name and belongs to a group classified by a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The survey includes several Likert-scale questions rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), such as Frequent_Usage, System_Complexity, and Ease_of_Use. The Frequent_Usage field specifically measures how much the respondent would like to use the system frequently, with 5 indicating Strongly Agree. The responses section lists three respondents with their respective answers to these questions.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have Group D?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey data with respondents identified as persons. Each respondent has a name and belongs to a group, which is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The group is recorded as a single letter code (A, B, C, D) in the responses, which maps to these options. Additional Likert-scale questions (1–5) capture various opinions about system usage and complexity. The responses section lists individual respondents with their group codes and answers to the Likert questions.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have Group C?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents identified by unique IDs and their answers to various questions. Each respondent is classified into a group based on a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Group"" field in the responses uses letter codes (A, B, C, D) corresponding to these options. The data includes Likert scale responses (1–5) for various usability and system-related questions. The focus is on counting how many respondents belong to the ""Middle"" group, which corresponds to Group C.

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

How many respondents have Frequent_Usage 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions describing respondent attributes and their answers, including group membership and various Likert scale responses. The ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Frequent_Usage"" question measures how often respondents would like to use the system, rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective answers to these questions. This structure allows counting respondents based on specific criteria such as their Frequent_Usage rating.

How many respondents have Frequent_Usage 2?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The dataset contains survey responses from individuals identified as persons. Each respondent has a name and belongs to a group classified by a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The survey includes several Likert-scale questions rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), including ""Frequent_Usage,"" which measures how often the respondent would like to use the system. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to these questions. The ""Frequent_Usage"" field is a numeric Likert score indicating the respondent's frequency preference.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
How many respondents have Ease_of_Use 5?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual respondents identified as persons. Each respondent has a name and belongs to a group categorized as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), including Ease_of_Use, which measures how easy the respondent found the system to use. The data records the numeric responses for each question per respondent. This structure allows analysis of respondent opinions and group characteristics based on their answers.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have System_Complexity 3?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual respondents identified by unique respondent IDs. Each respondent is classified into a group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern) based on a multiple-choice question. The survey includes several Likert-scale questions rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), including System_Complexity, which measures perceived system complexity. Responses are recorded as numeric strings corresponding to these Likert ratings. The data allows analysis of respondent distribution across groups and their perceptions of the system.
