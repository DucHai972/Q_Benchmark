<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a group of A?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple clinicians, each identified by a unique respondent ID. Each respondent's data includes their name, group classification, and answers to various Likert-scale questions about system usability and complexity. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern, represented by letters A, B, C, and D respectively. The responses provide numeric scores or text values corresponding to each question. This structure allows for analysis of respondents by group and their perceptions of the system.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","Specification and Description:  
The dataset consists of survey responses from individuals identified as respondents. Each respondent is characterized by their name, group membership, and answers to various Likert-scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The group field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The inconsistency score reflects the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system, with 1 indicating strong disagreement that the system is inconsistent. The data allows mapping of coded group letters to their full descriptive names.

Who has a need for technical support score of 5?
</task>","Specification and Description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual clinicians identified by respondent IDs. Each respondent has attributes including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and scores on various Likert-scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Need for Technical Support"" question measures the respondent's perceived need for technical assistance to use the system. The data allows mapping group codes to descriptive group names and provides detailed individual scores for analysis.

The survey includes Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) assessing various aspects of system usability, such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and inconsistency. The inconsistency score reflects the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree. The data allows mapping of coded group letters to their full descriptive names.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The table contains survey data from respondents about their experience with a system, including their name, group, and various Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects. The group field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include scores for frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome to use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The data is structured with predicates linking respondents to their answers. The integration of functions score indicates how well respondents felt the system's functions were integrated.

Who has a ease of learning score of 5?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individuals identified as persons. Each respondent has a name and belongs to a group classified as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Ease of Learning. The Ease of Learning question measures how quickly respondents believe most people would learn to use the system. The responses section lists each respondent’s answers to these questions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data from respondents about their experience with a system, including their name, group, and various Likert scale ratings (1–5) on system attributes such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and confidence in use. The group field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers are recorded as text values corresponding to their ratings or group codes. The system complexity score indicates how complex the respondent found the system, with 1 meaning ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system was unnecessarily complex. The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores for each question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

Each respondent is characterized by their name, group membership (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and their answers to various Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) about system usability and experience. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A to D mapped to specific group names. The ""Frequent Usage"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement about frequent system use, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Other fields capture perceptions of system complexity, ease of use, need for support, integration, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a ease of learning score of 4?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from individuals identified as clinicians, each with attributes such as name, group, and various Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The Likert-scale questions measure perceptions like frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and ease of learning, among others. Each respondent's data includes their scores for these questions, allowing analysis of their attitudes toward the system. The data is structured in RDF format with predicates linking respondents to their answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual clinicians identified by respondent IDs. Each respondent has attributes including their name, group (with options Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert-scale scores (1 to 5) for different usability questions. The ""Cumbersome to Use"" field measures how awkward the respondent found the system, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. The data includes both categorical (group) and numeric (Likert scores) fields. This structure allows analysis of user perceptions and usability ratings.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a group of A?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents identified by unique IDs and their attributes. Each respondent is a person with fields including Name (open-ended), Group (multiple choice with options Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert scale responses (1–5) to questions about system usage and perceptions. The Group field uses letter codes A, B, C, D mapped to Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern respectively. The data records individual responses to questions about system complexity, ease of use, confidence, and other usability factors. This structure allows analysis of respondent characteristics and their attitudes toward the system.

The table contains survey responses from individual clinicians identified by respondent IDs. Each respondent has attributes including their name, group membership (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and scores on various Likert-scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Need to Learn Before Use"" question measures how much the respondent felt they needed to learn before using the system. The data allows mapping group codes to descriptive group names and provides detailed individual scores for analysis.

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual clinicians identified by respondent IDs. Each respondent has attributes including their name, group membership (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and scores on various Likert-scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""System Complexity"" field measures the respondent's perception of the system's complexity, with 1 indicating strong disagreement that the system is unnecessarily complex. The data allows mapping group codes to descriptive group names and provides detailed individual responses for analysis.

<task>
Who has a need for technical support score of 5?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians identified by respondent IDs and names. Each respondent belongs to a group classified as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey includes Likert scale questions (1 to 5) measuring various usability aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, Need for Technical Support, and others. The ""Need for Technical Support"" question assesses the extent to which respondents feel they require technical assistance to use the system, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree. The responses provide numeric scores for each question per respondent.

<task>
Who has a cumbersome to use score of 3?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from individuals identified as respondents, each with attributes such as Name, Group, and various Likert scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects. The Group field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each Likert scale question measures agreement levels from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5) on different usability factors like Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Cumbersome to Use. The data allows mapping coded responses to descriptive text for MCQ fields and direct values for open-ended or numeric fields. This structure supports detailed analysis of user perceptions about the system.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individuals identified as clinicians. Each respondent is characterized by their name, group membership (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and their answers to various Likert-scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Inconsistency"" field measures the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system. The data allows mapping group codes to descriptive group names and interpreting numeric scores according to the Likert scale.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a need for technical support score of 2?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from individuals identified as clinicians, each with attributes such as name, group membership, and various Likert-scale scores measuring their perceptions of a system. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The Likert-scale questions range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) and cover aspects like frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, and confidence in use. Each respondent's data is structured with predicates linking to their answers. This format allows for straightforward extraction of specific scores or attributes for analysis.

</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual clinicians identified by respondent IDs. Each respondent is characterized by their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and answers to various Likert-scale questions (1–5) about their experience with a system. The ""Integration of Functions"" question measures how well the respondent felt the system's functions were integrated, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree. The data allows mapping group codes to full group names and interpreting numeric scores as levels of agreement or disagreement.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data from respondents identified as clinicians, each associated with a group category (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The key variable of interest is the ""Frequent Usage"" score, which is a Likert scale rating from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) indicating the respondent's willingness to use the system frequently. Other variables include perceptions of system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, and confidence in use, all rated on the same Likert scale. Group codes are mapped to descriptive group names. The data allows identification of respondents by name and group, along with their respective scores on these usability questions.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a frequent usage score of 2?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from individuals identified as clinicians, each with attributes such as name, group, and various Likert scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability and complexity. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Frequent Usage"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement about frequent system use, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Each respondent's data includes their scores for system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, and other usability factors.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a confidence in use score of 1?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual clinicians identified by respondent IDs. Each respondent has attributes including their name, group (with options Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert-scale scores (1 to 5) for questions about system usage, complexity, ease of use, technical support, integration, inconsistency, learning ease, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The group field is a multiple-choice question with letter codes mapped to group names. The Likert scores represent degrees of agreement or disagreement with statements about the system. The data allows analysis of individual perceptions and experiences with the system.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a ease of use score of 1?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual clinicians identified by respondent IDs. Each respondent has a name, group classification (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and scores on various Likert-scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Ease of Use"" question measures how easy the respondent found the system to use, with 1 indicating strong disagreement (very difficult to use). The data allows mapping group codes to descriptive group names and extracting specific scores for analysis.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a cumbersome to use score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from multiple clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scales (1–5) for various usability aspects. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and name, with their group membership coded as a multiple-choice question (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The responses include scores for system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome to use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The ""cumbersome to use"" score indicates how awkward the respondent found the system, with 1 meaning ""Strongly Disagree"" (not cumbersome). The data allows mapping of coded group letters to their full text descriptions.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 2?
</task>","Specification and description of the table:  
The dataset contains survey responses from individuals identified as respondents. Each respondent has a name and belongs to a group classified as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey includes Likert scale questions (1 to 5) measuring various perceptions about system usage, such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and confidence in use. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with letter codes mapped to group names. The ""Frequent Usage"" field indicates how much the respondent agrees with the statement about wanting to use the system frequently, scored from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","Specification and Description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual clinicians identified by respondent IDs. Each respondent is characterized by their name, group membership (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and their answers to various Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) about system usability and experience. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with four options mapped from letters to group names. The Likert-scale questions measure agreement levels, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The ""Inconsistency"" score reflects the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system, with lower scores indicating less perceived inconsistency.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a system complexity score of 5?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from individual clinicians identified by respondent IDs. Each respondent has attributes including their name, group membership (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and scores on various Likert-scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""System Complexity"" field measures how unnecessarily complex the respondent found the system. The data allows mapping group codes to descriptive group names and interpreting numeric scores according to the Likert scale. This structure supports analysis of user perceptions and experiences with the system.
