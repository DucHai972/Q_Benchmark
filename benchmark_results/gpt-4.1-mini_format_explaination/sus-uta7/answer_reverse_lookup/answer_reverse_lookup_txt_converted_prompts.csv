<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about respondents' demographics and their perceptions of a system's usability and complexity, measured on Likert scales from 1 to 5. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their name, group, and ratings on various system attributes such as Frequent Usage, Ease of Use, and Confidence in Use. The data is structured with clear mappings between question codes and their meanings, allowing precise interpretation of responses.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with responses from clinicians about their experience using a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and name, and belongs to a specific group (Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern). The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) assessing various aspects such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and inconsistency. The inconsistency score reflects the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system, where 1 means Strongly Disagree (i.e., no inconsistency perceived). The responses section lists individual answers for each question from different clinicians.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a need for technical support score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with responses from clinicians about their experience using a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and has attributes including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, and confidence in use. The Likert scale values range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of individual perceptions and needs related to the system.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a confidence in use score of 4?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents' names, group classifications, and their ratings on various system usability aspects using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with four categories: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their perceived frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The data is structured with clear question definitions followed by individual respondent data. This allows for precise identification of respondents based on specific scores or attributes.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a group of A?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about respondents' demographics and their perceptions of a system's usability and complexity. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and has attributes such as Name (open-ended), Group (multiple choice with options Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert scale responses (1 to 5) measuring aspects like Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Confidence in Use. The Group field categorizes respondents into four groups: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The Likert scale responses indicate levels of agreement or disagreement with statements about the system. The data allows analysis of user experience and group-based comparisons.

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with responses from clinicians about their experience using a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and has attributes including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and others. The System Complexity field measures how complex the respondent found the system, with 1 indicating ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex. The data includes three respondents with their respective scores for each question.

Who has a need for technical support score of 2?
</task>","The table contains survey data with responses from clinicians about their experience using a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and has attributes including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Need for Technical Support. The Need for Technical Support field indicates how much support a respondent thinks they would need to use the system, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. The data includes three respondents with their respective scores for each question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a confidence in use score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents' names, group classifications, and their ratings on various system usability aspects using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with four categories: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their perceived frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome to use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The Likert scale values indicate levels of agreement or disagreement with each statement, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The data allows analysis of user perceptions and confidence in using the system.

Who has a need for technical support score of 5?
</task>","Specification and Description:  
The table contains survey data with responses from clinicians about their experience using a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and has a name and group classification (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) assessing various aspects such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, and confidence in use. The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" question measures the respondent's perceived need for technical assistance, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. The data allows analysis of individual responses to identify specific scores for each question.

Each respondent is identified by a unique number and provides their name and group classification, which includes Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The key metric of interest is the ""Frequent_Usage"" score, rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), indicating the respondent's willingness to use the system frequently. Additional fields assess perceptions of system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness, confidence in use, and the need to learn before use.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","Specification and Description:  
The table contains survey data with responses from clinicians about their experience using a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and has attributes including their name and group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The survey uses Likert scales (1 to 5) to measure various perceptions such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and inconsistency. The ""Inconsistency"" field specifically measures the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., they do not find the system inconsistent) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" The data allows analysis of individual responses based on these metrics.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a confidence in use score of 5?
</task>","Specification and Description:  
The table contains survey data from clinicians evaluating a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and has a name and group classification (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) assessing various aspects such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The Likert scale ranges from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of individual responses to understand user perceptions and experiences with the system.

</task>","The table contains survey data with responses from clinicians about their experience using a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and has attributes including their name and group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The survey uses Likert scales (1 to 5) to measure various perceptions such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and confidence in use. The ""Confidence_in_Use"" field specifically measures how confident the respondent felt using the system, with 1 indicating ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 indicating ""Strongly Agree.""

</task>","Specification and Description:  
The table captures survey responses from clinicians regarding their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and name, and belongs to a specific group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). The survey uses Likert scales (1 to 5) to measure various perceptions such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The Likert scale ranges from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of user attitudes and confidence towards the system.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a cumbersome to use score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about respondents' perceptions of a system, including their group classification, frequency of use, and various usability factors rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question. Each Likert scale question measures agreement or disagreement with statements about system complexity, ease of use, technical support needs, integration, inconsistency, learning ease, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The data allows analysis of user experience and system usability based on respondent group and ratings.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about respondents' perceptions of a system, including their group classification, frequency of usage, and various usability factors measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers are recorded with their name, group, and scores for different system attributes such as System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Inconsistency. The Inconsistency score indicates the respondent's agreement with the statement about inconsistency in the system, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective scores.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about respondents' perceptions of a system, including their group classification and various Likert scale ratings from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their name, group, and scores on system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, and other usability factors. The data is structured to allow analysis of individual responses based on these criteria.
