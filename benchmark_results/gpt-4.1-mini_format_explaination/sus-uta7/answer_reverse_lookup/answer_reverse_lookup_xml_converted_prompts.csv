<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a group of A?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians, with each respondent identified by an ID and name. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Other fields are Likert scale questions (1 to 5) measuring various perceptions about system usage, complexity, ease of use, and confidence. Each respondent's answers provide insight into their experience and attitudes toward the system. The data allows mapping of coded responses to descriptive text for clear interpretation.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a confidence in use score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about their group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with four possible categories. The ""Name"" field is open-ended, providing the respondent's name. The data allows analysis of individual responses to understand user perceptions and experiences with the system.

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","The table contains responses from clinicians who answered a questionnaire about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert-scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usage, complexity, ease of use, and other usability factors. The ""Inconsistency"" question measures the perceived inconsistency in the system, with 1 indicating ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., low inconsistency). The data allows mapping of coded group responses to their full text descriptions and includes open-ended name fields.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a need for technical support score of 3?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects. The ""Need for Technical Support"" question measures the extent to which respondents feel they would need technical help to use the system, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. The data allows mapping of coded group letters to full group names and extraction of specific scores per respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert-scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Inconsistency. The ""Inconsistency"" question measures the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system, with 1 meaning ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., no inconsistency perceived) and 5 meaning ""Strongly Agree"" (high inconsistency). The data allows mapping of group codes to full group names and interpretation of Likert scores.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a integration of functions score of 5?
</task>","The table contains responses from clinicians who answered a questionnaire about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usage, complexity, ease of use, and other usability factors. The ""Integration_of_Functions"" question measures how well the respondents felt the system's functions were integrated, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows mapping of group codes to their full text and provides detailed individual scores for analysis.

The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert-scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usage, complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" question measures the respondent's perceived need for technical help, with 1 meaning ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., no need) and 5 meaning ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., high need).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a ease of learning score of 5?
</task>","The table contains responses from clinicians who answered a questionnaire about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert scale ratings from 1 to 5. The Likert scale questions assess aspects such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome to use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with four possible categories. The data allows analysis of individual responses based on these criteria.

Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usage, complexity, ease of use, technical support needs, integration, inconsistency, learning ease, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Confidence_in_Use"" question measures how confident the respondent felt using the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows mapping of group codes to descriptive group names and extraction of specific scores for analysis.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scales and multiple-choice questions. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about system usage, complexity, ease of use, and other usability factors. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. Likert scale questions range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of individual responses to specific usability attributes.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a ease of learning score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scales and multiple-choice questions. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about their group, system usage frequency, perceived complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The Likert scale questions range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of individual responses to each question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 3?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scales and multiple-choice questions. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about their group, system usage frequency, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Frequent_Usage"" question measures the respondent's agreement with using the system frequently on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Responses are structured in XML format with each respondent's answers nested under their ID.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a cumbersome to use score of 2?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects. The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" question measures how awkward the system was to use, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree. The data allows mapping of coded group letters to their full text and provides detailed individual scores for each question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a need to learn before use score of 2?
</task>","The table contains responses from multiple clinicians to a questionnaire assessing their perceptions of a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group affiliation, and Likert scale ratings (1–5) on system usage, complexity, ease of use, and other usability factors. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The Likert scale questions measure agreement levels, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. This structured data allows analysis of individual responses to specific questions.

The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Name"" field is open-ended, providing the respondent's name. The key metric for this task is the ""System_Complexity"" score, which ranges from 1 (Strongly Disagree that the system is complex) to 5 (Strongly Agree).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a ease of learning score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using various Likert scale questions (1–5) and multiple-choice group classifications. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about system usability, complexity, and confidence. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Ease_of_Learning"" question measures how quickly respondents think most people would learn to use the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows mapping of coded responses to descriptive text and numerical scores for analysis.

Who has a need for technical support score of 2?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects. The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" question measures the respondent's perceived need for technical help, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. The data allows mapping of coded group letters to full group names and extraction of specific scores for analysis.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

Who has a ease of learning score of 4?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians regarding their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert-scale ratings from 1 to 5. The ""Ease_of_Learning"" question measures how quickly respondents think most people would learn to use the system, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree. The data allows mapping of group codes to their full text and extraction of specific scores for analysis.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians, with each respondent identified by an ID and providing answers to various questions about their experience with a system. The questions include open-ended fields like ""Name"" and multiple-choice questions such as ""Group,"" which categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. Likert scale questions (1–5) assess opinions on system usage, complexity, ease of use, and confidence. Each respondent's answers are recorded under their unique ID, allowing for analysis of individual and group-level data. The ""Group"" field uses letter codes mapped to descriptive categories for clarity.

Who has a cumbersome to use score of 3?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects. The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" question measures how awkward the system was to use, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. The data allows mapping of group codes to their full text and analysis of individual scores for each question.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scales and multiple-choice questions. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about their group, system usage frequency, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Frequent_Usage"" field measures the respondent's agreement with using the system frequently on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data includes three respondents with their respective scores.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data from respondents who answered questions about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group affiliation, and Likert scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability aspects such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and inconsistency. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The Likert scale questions measure agreement levels, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The data allows analysis of individual responses to specific questions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scale questions (1–5) and multiple-choice group classifications. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about system usage frequency, complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Name"" field is open-ended, providing the respondent's name. The data allows analysis of individual responses based on these structured questions.

Other fields are Likert scale questions (1 to 5) measuring opinions on system usage, complexity, ease of use, and confidence. Each respondent's answers provide insight into their perceptions and experiences with the system. The data allows mapping of coded responses to descriptive text for clear interpretation.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a frequent usage score of 2?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usage and usability aspects. The ""Frequent_Usage"" question measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" The data allows mapping of group codes to their full names and interpretation of Likert scores for analysis.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 4?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scales and multiple-choice questions. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about their group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), their perception of system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Frequent_Usage"" question measures the respondent's agreement with the statement about wanting to use the system frequently, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data includes three respondents with their respective scores for each question. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with four possible groups.

Who has a confidence in use score of 5?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usage, complexity, ease of use, technical support needs, integration, inconsistency, learning ease, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The ""Confidence_in_Use"" question measures how confident the respondent felt using the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows mapping of group codes to their full text and extraction of specific scores per respondent.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a confidence in use score of 1?
</task>","Specification and description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usage, complexity, ease of use, and confidence. The ""Confidence_in_Use"" question measures how confident the respondent felt using the system, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree. The data allows mapping of coded group letters to their full text descriptions.

Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usage, complexity, ease of use, technical support needs, integration, inconsistency, learning ease, awkwardness, confidence, and learning requirements. The Likert scale ranges from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Confidence_in_Use"" question measures how confident the respondent felt using the system, rated on this scale. The data allows mapping group codes to full group names and extracting exact text for open-ended fields.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a ease of use score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scales and multiple-choice questions. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about their group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), their perception of system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, awkwardness of use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The ""Ease_of_Use"" question measures how easy the system was to use on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data includes three respondents with their respective scores for each question.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a cumbersome to use score of 1?
</task>","Specification and Description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability aspects. The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" question measures how awkward the system was to use, with 1 meaning ""Strongly Disagree"" (not cumbersome) and 5 meaning ""Strongly Agree"" (very cumbersome). The data allows mapping of group codes to their full text and extraction of specific scores for analysis.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 2?
</task>","The table contains responses from clinicians who answered a questionnaire about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to various questions, including their name, group, and several Likert-scale ratings from 1 to 5. The ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Frequent_Usage"" question measures how much the respondent agrees with using the system frequently, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Other questions assess system complexity, ease of use, need for support, and confidence, among others.

Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions including their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert-scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and others. The ""Ease of Use"" question measures how easy the respondent thought the system was to use, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows mapping group codes to their full text and extracting specific scores for analysis.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a group of A?
</task>","The table contains survey data from respondents who evaluated a system using various Likert scale questions and multiple-choice group classification. Each respondent is identified by an ID and a name, with their group membership coded as A, B, C, or D, corresponding to Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern respectively. The Likert scale questions measure agreement levels from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) on different aspects of system usability and complexity. The data allows analysis of individual responses and group-based trends. The group field is a multiple-choice question with four possible categories.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","Specification and Description:  
The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using various Likert scale questions (1 to 5) and categorical groupings. Each respondent is identified by an ID and a name. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Inconsistency"" field measures the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The data allows analysis of individual responses to understand user experience and system usability.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians evaluating a system using various Likert scale questions (1–5) and multiple-choice group classifications. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides answers to questions about system complexity, ease of use, confidence, and other usability factors. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The ""Name"" field is open-ended, providing the respondent's name. The data allows analysis of individual scores for specific questions such as ""System Complexity.""
