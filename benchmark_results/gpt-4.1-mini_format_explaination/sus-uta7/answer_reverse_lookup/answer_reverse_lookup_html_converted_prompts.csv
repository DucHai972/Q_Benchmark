<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a group of A?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents' demographic and usability feedback. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and name. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into four groups: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The survey includes Likert scale responses (1 to 5) on various system usability aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Confidence in Use. The data allows mapping coded group letters to their full descriptive names.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a confidence in use score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about respondents' demographics and their opinions on system usability, measured on Likert scales from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their name, group, and scores for various usability aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Confidence in Use. The data is structured in HTML format with each respondent's data grouped under their respondent number. This allows for easy identification and comparison of individual responses.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions describing each field, including respondent name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and others. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to these questions. Each Likert scale score represents the degree of agreement or disagreement with the statement, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The Group field is a multiple-choice question with letter codes mapped to group names. The data allows analysis of user perceptions and experiences with the system.

Who has a integration of functions score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians regarding their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and name, and belongs to a group classified as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) assessing aspects such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The ""Integration_of_Functions"" field measures how well the various functions in the system were integrated, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a need for technical support score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians regarding their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and name, and belongs to a group classified as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey uses Likert scales (1 to 5) to measure various aspects such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, and confidence in use. The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field specifically indicates the respondent's agreement with needing technical help to use the system, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" The data allows mapping of coded group letters to their full descriptive names.

<task>
Who has a ease of learning score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents' demographic group, their names, and their ratings on various system usability aspects measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their perceived frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome to use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The data is structured with each respondent's information grouped under their respondent number. The Likert scale responses provide insight into user experience and system usability.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians who responded to a questionnaire about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and name, and belongs to a specific group (Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern). The survey includes multiple Likert-scale questions (1 to 5) assessing various aspects such as frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, and confidence in use. The ""System_Complexity"" field measures how complex the respondent found the system, with 1 indicating ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system was unnecessarily complex. The responses section lists individual scores for each question per respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a need to learn before use score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data from clinicians evaluating a system using Likert scale questions (1 to 5) and multiple-choice group classifications. Each respondent's data includes their name, group (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and scores on various usability and system complexity aspects. The ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" field measures how much learning was needed before using the system, rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The responses section lists individual clinician data with their respective scores. This structure allows analysis of user experience and system usability across different groups.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions describing various aspects of system usability and user experience, each measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Respondents are identified by a unique number and name, and belong to a group categorized as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The responses section lists individual answers for each question, including system complexity, ease of use, confidence in use, and others. The ""System_Complexity"" field specifically measures the respondent's perception of the system's complexity, with 1 indicating strong disagreement that the system is unnecessarily complex. This structured format allows for precise analysis of user feedback on the system.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a need for technical support score of 2?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about respondents' demographics and their ratings on various system usability aspects, measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their name, group, and scores for frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome to use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The data is structured in HTML format with clear separation between questions and individual responses. This allows for straightforward extraction and interpretation of each respondent's scores.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a integration of functions score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions describing each field, including respondent details such as Name and Group, and various Likert scale ratings (1–5) on system usability aspects. The Group field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The Likert scale fields measure agreement levels from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5) on statements about system usage, complexity, ease, and confidence. Responses are provided for three respondents, each with their respective scores for all fields. This structure allows for analysis of individual respondent ratings on different usability factors.

Who has a ease of learning score of 4?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians about their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and name, and belongs to a group classified as Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern. The survey uses Likert scales (1 to 5) to measure various aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Ease of Learning, among others. The data captures subjective ratings on system usability and confidence, as well as technical support needs. This structured format allows for analysis of user perceptions and system evaluation.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a confidence in use score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions about respondents' demographics and their opinions on system usability, measured on Likert scales from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers are listed under their unique respondent number, including their name, group, and scores for various usability aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Confidence in Use. The data allows mapping coded responses to descriptive text for MCQ fields and direct values for open-ended and Likert scale fields. This structure supports detailed analysis of user feedback on system usability.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 5?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians regarding their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique respondent number and name. The ""Group"" field categorizes respondents into four groups: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The survey uses Likert scales (1 to 5) to measure various aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Confidence in Use. The data captures both subjective opinions and technical support needs related to the system.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions describing each field, including respondent name, group, and various Likert scale ratings from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question. Each respondent's data includes their name, group, and scores for system attributes such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and others. The data allows analysis of user perceptions and experiences with the system.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 2?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents' demographic group and their ratings on various system usability aspects, measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their name, group, and scores for frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome to use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The data is structured in HTML format with clear labeling for each question and response. This allows for precise extraction and interpretation of individual respondent scores.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 4?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents' demographic group and their ratings on various system usability aspects, measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their name, group, and scores for frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome to use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The data is structured in HTML format with clear separation between questions (schema) and responses. This allows for precise mapping of coded responses to their descriptive meanings.

Who has a confidence in use score of 1?
</task>","Specification and Description:  
The table contains survey data from respondents about their experience with a system. Each respondent has an open-ended Name field and a Group field, which is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. The survey includes several Likert scale questions (1 to 5) measuring various aspects such as Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Confidence in Use. The Confidence in Use field specifically measures how confident the respondent felt using the system, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a group of C?
</task>","The table contains survey data with questions describing respondent attributes and their Likert-scale responses to system usability and complexity. The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's data includes their name, group, and scores for various usability factors rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective answers. This structure allows mapping coded responses to descriptive text and analyzing user feedback.

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 2?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents' demographic group and their ratings on various system usability aspects, measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern. Each respondent's answers include their name, group, and scores for frequent usage, system complexity, ease of use, need for technical support, integration of functions, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersome to use, confidence in use, and need to learn before use. The data is structured in HTML format with clear separation between questions (schema) and responses. This allows for precise mapping of coded responses to their descriptive meanings.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a group of A?
</task>","The table contains survey data with respondents' demographic and usability feedback. Each respondent has a Name (open-ended), Group (multiple choice: Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and several Likert-scale responses (1 to 5) about system usage and perceptions. The Group field uses letter codes mapped to specific group names. The responses section lists individual respondents with their answers to each question. This structure allows identification of respondents by group and analysis of their system usage ratings.

Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","The table contains survey responses from clinicians regarding their experience with a system. Each respondent is identified by a unique respondent number and name. The data includes demographic information such as the group of the respondent (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern) and various Likert scale ratings (1 to 5) on system usability aspects like Frequent Usage, System Complexity, Ease of Use, and Inconsistency. The Inconsistency field measures the respondent's perception of inconsistency in the system, with 1 indicating Strongly Disagree (i.e., low inconsistency).
