Background (history): Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]\n6. Background (examination): Gives appropriate examination/observations.

Assessment: Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]\n8. Recommendation (clear recommendation): Makes a clear recommendation. [Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]\n9. Recommendation (global rating scale): Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]\n10.

Date: What is the date of the session? [Open-ended]\n2. SessionName: What is the name of the session? [Open-ended]\n3. Identification: Identification of self, role, and patient. [Rubric: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete]\n4. Situation: Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]\n5. Background (history): Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]\n6. Background (examination): Gives appropriate examination/observations. [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]\n7. Assessment: Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]\n8. Recommendation (clear recommendation): Makes a clear recommendation. [Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]\n9. Recommendation (global rating scale): Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]\n10. Comments: Comments on the session.

Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.\n\nYou will be given a dataset with two key parts:\n\nA 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.\n\nA 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.\n\nOUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:\nProvide your final answer directly and concisely. Your output should contain only the answer itself, without explaining your thought process or methodology. For example:\n\nIf the question asks for a count, provide only the final number (e.g., \"42\").\n\nIf the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide them as a simple comma-separated list (e.g., \"17, 21, 23\").\n\nIf the question asks for a specific text comment, provide only that text.\n\nQUESTION:\nHow many respondents scored 2 or 3 on background history?\n\nDATA:\n\nSurvey Data\n==================================================\n\nQuestions:\n1. Date: What is the date of the session? [Open-ended]\n2. SessionName: What is the name of the session? [Open-ended]\n3. Identification: Identification of self, role, and patient. [Rubric: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete]\n4. Situation: Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]\n5. Background (history): Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]\n6. Background (examination): Gives appropriate examination/observations. [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]\n7. Assessment: Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]\n8. Recommendation (clear recommendation): Makes a clear recommendation. [Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]\n9. Recommendation (global rating scale): Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]\n10. Comments: Comments on the session.
