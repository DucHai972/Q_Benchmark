<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (11, 16, and 18) evaluated on multiple clinical criteria with scores ranging from 0 to 3. Each respondent has complete data for Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" scores vary among respondents, with values of 3, 2, and 3 respectively. Respondent 16 is the only one with a recommendation score of 2, indicating a clear recommendation after minimal questioning. The other respondents have scores of 3, indicating clear comprehensive recommendations without questioning.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (12, 15, and 19) evaluated on multiple clinical criteria with scores ranging from -1 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance. The ""Assessment"" field measures the logical clinical assessment ability, scored from 0 (no logical assessment) to 3 (comprehensive logical assessment without questioning). Respondent 12 has an Assessment score of 3, respondent 15 has a score of 2, and respondent 19 has a score of 3. Only respondent 15 has an Assessment score exactly equal to 2, which corresponds to a good clinical assessment score as defined. Other fields show some variation, but the question focuses solely on the Assessment score.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents, each evaluated on multiple clinical assessment criteria with scores ranging from -1 to 3. The ""Background (examination)"" field measures the appropriateness of examination/observations, with 1 indicating ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed."" Among the three respondents, scores for this field are 1, 3, and -1, showing some variation in performance. Two respondents have valid positive scores, while one has a negative score (-1), which likely indicates missing or invalid data. The respondent with a score of 1 in ""Background (examination)"" is the only one with a moderate score in this category.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents, each evaluated on multiple clinical and communication criteria with scores ranging from 0 to 3. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field measures how clearly the respondent made a recommendation, with 1 indicating a clear recommendation only after extended questioning. Among the three respondents, only respondent 3 has a recommendation score of 1. The other respondents have scores of 2 or 3 in this field. This indicates that respondent 3 made a moderate recommendation score according to the rubric.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (6, 7, and 8) evaluated on multiple clinical criteria with scores ranging from -1 to 3. The ""Assessment"" field measures the logical clinical assessment ability, with 2 indicating ""Assessment after minimal questioning."" Respondent 6 scored 3, respondent 8 scored 3, and respondent 7 scored 2 on the Assessment rubric. The other fields show mostly high scores (2 or 3), indicating generally good performance across respondents.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (23, 17, and 15) evaluated on multiple clinical assessment criteria with scores ranging from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate better performance. The ""Background (examination)"" field measures the appropriateness of examination/observations, with 0 meaning omitted or irrelevant and 3 meaning comprehensive focused examination. Among the three respondents, scores for ""Background (examination)"" are 1, 2, and 3, showing a range from minimal to comprehensive examination quality. Only respondent 23 has a score of 1, which corresponds to ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed,"" indicating a moderate level of background examination.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (1, 8, and 7) evaluated on multiple clinical assessment criteria, each scored from 0 to 3 based on a detailed rubric. The ""Situation"" field measures the ability to identify the main problem(s), with scores ranging from 2 to 3 in this dataset. Respondent 8 has the highest Situation score of 3, indicating unprompted identification and prioritization of problems. Respondent 1 also scored 3, while respondent 7 scored 2, which corresponds to identifying the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed. The data shows that only respondent 7 has a Situation score exactly equal to 2.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (15, 19, and 12) with scores for various clinical assessment criteria. Each respondent's answers include ratings from 0 to 3 for Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). One respondent (12) has an invalid score (-1) for Background (examination), which is an outlier. The Assessment scores are 2 for respondent 15 and 3 for respondents 19 and 12. The question asks for a respondent with an Assessment score of 2, which only respondent 15 has.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents, each evaluated on multiple clinical assessment criteria scored from 0 to 3. The ""Situation"" field measures the ability to identify the main problem(s), with scores ranging from 2 (identifies with fewer prompts) to 3 (identifies unprompted). Two respondents scored a 3 in Situation, indicating strong performance, while one respondent scored a 2, indicating a good but slightly less independent identification. The data shows consistent high scores in Identification and Assessment across respondents, with some variation in Background and Recommendation scores.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (6, 10, and 3) evaluated on multiple clinical performance criteria with scores ranging from -1 to 3. Most respondents scored high (2 or 3) on Identification, Situation, Background (history), and Assessment, indicating generally good performance. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" scores vary from 1 to 3, with only one respondent scoring 1, which indicates a clear recommendation only after extended questioning. The ""Assessment"" and ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" fields also show some variation but mostly remain high.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (4, 21, and 15) evaluated on multiple clinical assessment criteria using a rubric scale from 0 to 3. Each respondent's answers include identification, situation, background (history and examination), assessment, recommendation, and a global rating scale, along with comments. The background (examination) scores vary among respondents: one has a score of 1, one has 2, and one has 3, showing a range of performance in this area. The score of 1 for background (examination) indicates that observations were reported but frequent clarification was needed. This score appears only once in the dataset, making it straightforward to identify the respondent with this moderate score.

Respondent 4 has a background (examination) score of 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (12, 18, and 14) with scores for various clinical assessment criteria. Each respondent's answers include ratings from 0 to 3 for multiple rubric-based questions, with one instance of a -1 score indicating missing or invalid data. The ""Situation"" field measures the ability to identify the main problem(s) with scores ranging from 0 (unable) to 3 (unprompted identification and prioritization). Among the respondents, the ""Situation"" scores are 3, 3, and 2 respectively, showing that most identified the main problem(s) well, with one respondent scoring exactly 2. The data is consistent with the rubric definitions and allows direct comparison of scores.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (5, 9, and 4) evaluated on multiple clinical communication and assessment criteria, each scored from 0 to 3 based on a detailed rubric. The Identification scores vary among respondents: one respondent scored 0, one scored 2, and one scored 3. Other fields such as Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale) mostly have scores ranging from 1 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance. Comments are brief and mostly time stamps or notes on communication. The Identification field specifically measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and their role, with 0 indicating the need for direct prompting.

Respondent 5 has a poor identification score of 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (21, 22, and 9) evaluated on multiple clinical communication and assessment criteria, each scored from 0 to 3 based on a detailed rubric. The ""Identification"" field measures how well the respondent introduces themselves, their role, and the patient, with 2 indicating incomplete information.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains three respondents with their answers scored according to a rubric for various clinical assessment criteria. Each respondent's answers include both numerical rubric scores and open-ended comments. The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field is scored from 0 to 3, where 1 indicates a clear recommendation only after extended questioning. Among the three respondents, only one has a recommendation score of 1, while the others have scores of 2 or 3. This shows a variation in the clarity and confidence of recommendations made by respondents.

The ""Identification"" field measures how well the respondent introduces themselves and their role, with 0 indicating the need for direct prompting and 3 indicating a complete introduction without prompting. Among the respondents, only respondent 5 has an Identification score of 0, while respondents 10 and 11 both scored 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents, each evaluated on multiple clinical assessment criteria with scores ranging from 0 to 3. The ""Background (history)"" field measures the relevance and structure of the patient's history provided, with 2 indicating ""Relevant history with few further questions needed."" Among the three respondents, two scored a 3 in this field, indicating comprehensive focused history, while one respondent scored a 2. The scores are consistent with the rubric definitions, and the data shows no missing values. The respondents vary in other scores, but only one matches the requested background history score of 2.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents, each evaluated on multiple clinical assessment criteria with scores ranging from 0 to 3. The ""Background (examination)"" field measures the appropriateness of examination/observations, where 1 indicates ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed."" Among the three respondents, only one has a score of 1 in this field. The other respondents have scores of 2 or 3, indicating better performance in examination reporting.
