<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 17?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (17, 19, and 14) with answers to ten questions related to session details and performance rubrics. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (Identification, Situation, Background history and examination, Assessment, Recommendation, and Global Rating Scale). The Identification field is scored from 0 to 3, indicating the completeness and spontaneity of self-introduction. Respondent 17's Identification score is explicitly provided as 3, which means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete."" The data is consistent with no missing values for the Identification field.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 5?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (5, 2, and 18) with answers to various questions about session details and performance ratings. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (e.g., Identification, Situation). The Identification field is scored from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more complete and confident self-introduction.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the session name for respondent 3?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (3, 20, and 12) with each providing answers to a set of questions about their session. The questions include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based ratings (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background). The ratings mostly range from -1 to 3, where -1 indicates missing or invalid data (as seen in Background (examination) for respondent 12). The session names are all open-ended text fields and vary by respondent, indicating different medical scenarios or session identifiers. The data shows a mix of complete and incomplete responses, with some fields having negative or missing values.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 1?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (1, 6, and 11) with various session dates and session names. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), Recommendation (global rating scale)). The rubric scores range from -1 (indicating missing or invalid data) to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance or confidence. Respondent 1 has complete data with an Assessment score of 2. Respondent 6 has one missing score (-1) for Identification but otherwise high scores.

What is the global rating score for respondent 11?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (11, 22, and 23) with each providing answers to ten questions related to session details and performance ratings. The questions include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based ratings scored from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or confidence. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, with scores ranging from 0 (not confident) to 3 (confident with little or no questioning). Respondent 11's data shows high scores across most rubric-based questions, including a global rating scale score of 3.

What is the global rating score for respondent 20?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (20, 4, and 17) with detailed answers to a set of questions about session evaluations. Each respondent's data includes open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based ratings for Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). The global rating scale is a rubric from 0 to 3 indicating confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, with 0 being not confident and 3 being very confident with little or no questioning. Respondent 20's global rating scale score is explicitly listed as 2 in the responses. This means the confidence level is ""Confident but required some further questioning.""

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 8?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (8, 2, and 9) with answers to ten questions related to session details and performance rubrics. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (e.g., Identification, Situation). The Identification rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating the completeness and spontaneity of self-introduction. Respondent 8 has a complete set of answers with the highest scores (mostly 3s) across all rubric fields, indicating strong performance. The data is consistent and structured, allowing direct retrieval of specific scores per respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (6, 19, and 5) with answers to ten questions related to session details and performance ratings. The ""Identification"" field has a range from -1 to 3, indicating some missing or invalid data (-1 for respondent 6). Most rubric-based fields (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) have scores between 0 and 3, reflecting varying levels of performance or confidence. Respondent 19 has consistently high scores (mostly 3s) except for the ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" which is 2.

Each respondent's data includes both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based ratings scored from 0 to 3, with one instance of a -1 indicating missing or invalid data. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" field measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, scored from 0 (not confident) to 3 (very confident). Respondent 19's global rating score is explicitly provided as 2. The data shows consistent use of the rubric scale across respondents, with no missing values for respondent 19 in this field.

What is the global rating score for respondent 2?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (2, 8, and 3) with answers to ten questions related to session details and performance ratings. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based ratings scored from 0 to 3 for various competencies such as Identification, Situation, and Recommendation. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, with scores ranging from 0 (Not at all confident) to 3 (Confident and required little or no questioning). Respondent 2's global rating score is explicitly provided as a numeric value in the responses. The data is consistent and structured, allowing direct extraction of the requested score.

What is the global rating score for respondent 3?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (3, 22, and 14) with each providing answers to ten questions related to session details and performance ratings. The questions include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based rating scales (e.g., Identification, Situation, Assessment). The rating scales use numeric values from 0 to 3, with higher numbers indicating better performance or confidence. Respondent 3's data shows a mix of high and low scores, with a notably low global rating scale score. The global rating scale question measures confidence in having received an accurate picture of the patient, scored from 0 (not confident) to 3 (very confident).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 15?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (15, 4, and 14) with answers to ten questions related to session details and performance rubrics. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (e.g., Identification, Situation). The Identification field is scored from 0 to 3, indicating the completeness and spontaneity of self-introduction. Respondent 15's Identification score is explicitly provided as 3, which means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete."" The data is consistent and structured, allowing direct retrieval of specific scores.

What is the identification score for respondent 16?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (16, 9, and 13) with answers to ten questions related to clinical sessions. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (e.g., Identification, Situation). The Identification field is scored from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more complete and confident self-introduction. Respondent 16 has a complete set of answers, including a score of 3 for Identification, which means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete.""

What is the global rating score for respondent 14?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (14, 15, and 12) with answers to ten questions related to session details and performance ratings. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based ratings scored from 0 to 3, with one instance of a -1 value indicating a possible missing or invalid response. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" field measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, scored from 0 (not confident) to 3 (very confident). Respondent 14's global rating score is explicitly provided as 3.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 18?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (18, 17, and 1) with answers to a set of questions about session details and performance ratings. Each respondent's data includes open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments, as well as rubric-based ratings for Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, Recommendation, and a Global Rating Scale. The Global Rating Scale is scored from 0 to 3, indicating confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, with higher scores reflecting greater confidence and less need for questioning. Respondent 18's Global Rating Scale score is provided as a numeric value in the responses section. The data is consistent and structured, allowing direct extraction of the requested value.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (4, 11, and 9) with each providing answers to a set of questions about their session. The questions include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based ratings (e.g., Identification, Situation). The session names vary and are mostly short codes or descriptive titles related to medical conditions or scenarios. Respondent 4's data includes a session date, session name, and various rubric scores, along with comments that provide additional context. The structure is consistent across respondents, allowing straightforward extraction of specific fields.

What is the global rating score for respondent 3?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (3, 21, and 1) with answers to ten questions related to session evaluation. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based ratings scored from 0 to 3, indicating levels of performance or confidence. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question measures confidence in the accuracy of the patient picture, with scores ranging from 0 (Not at all confident) to 3 (Confident and required little or no questioning). Respondent 3's global rating score is explicitly provided as a numeric value in the responses. The data is consistent and structured, allowing direct extraction of the requested score.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

What is the identification score for respondent 14?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three respondents (14, 17, and 5) with answers to ten questions related to session details and performance rubrics. Each respondent's answers include both open-ended fields (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (e.g., Identification, Situation). The Identification field is scored from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more complete self-introduction. Respondent 14's Identification score is explicitly provided as a numeric value in the responses section. The data is consistent and structured, allowing direct extraction of the requested score.
