For example:\n\nIf the question asks for a count, provide only the final number (e.g., \"42\").\n\nIf the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide them as a simple comma-separated list (e.g., \"17, 21, 23\").\n\nIf the question asks for a specific text comment, provide only that text.\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?\n\nDATA:\n\nSurvey Data\n==================================================\n\nQuestions:\n1. Date: What is the date of the session? [Open-ended]\n2. SessionName: What is the name of the session? [Open-ended]\n3. Identification: Identification of self, role, and patient. [Rubric: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete]\n4. Situation: Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]\n5. Background (history): Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]\n6. Background (examination): Gives appropriate examination/observations. [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]\n7. Assessment: Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]\n8. Recommendation (clear recommendation): Makes a clear recommendation. [Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]\n9. Recommendation (global rating scale): Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]\n10. Comments: Comments on the session.
