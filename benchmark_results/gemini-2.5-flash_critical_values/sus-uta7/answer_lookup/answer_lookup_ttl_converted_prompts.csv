<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the ease of use score for Clinician 40?
</task>","The critical values for the Likert scale questions range from 1 to 5, where 1 typically represents ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 represents ""Strongly Agree"" for positive statements, or vice-versa for negative statements. For ""Ease_of_Use"", a score of 1 indicates ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system was easy to use, while a score of 5 indicates ""Strongly Agree"". Clinician 40's score of 1 for ""Ease_of_Use"" is at the lowest end of this range, signifying a strong negative perception regarding the system's ease of use.

The 'Name' field is an open-ended text field, providing unique identifiers for each respondent. The specific scores for each question are critical for understanding individual perceptions of the system.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

What is the group for Clinician 10?
</task>","The critical values and ranges in the table relate to respondent demographics and their perceptions of a system. The 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A (Senior), B (Junior), C (Middle), and D (Intern), categorizing respondents by their professional level. Other fields, such as 'Frequent_Usage', 'System_Complexity', and 'Ease_of_Use', are Likert scale ratings from 1 to 5, indicating agreement or disagreement with statements about the system's usability and user experience. These scales provide a range from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), allowing for quantitative assessment of user feedback.

What is the need to learn before use score for Clinician 53?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relate to the Likert scale responses (1-5) for various system usability questions, where 1 typically indicates strong disagreement or ease/lack of need, and 5 indicates strong agreement or difficulty/strong need. For instance, a score of 1 for ""System Complexity"" means the system was not complex, while a 5 for ""Ease of Use"" means it was very easy. The ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with categories A, B, C, and D, representing Senior, Junior, Middle, and Intern roles, respectively. The ""Name"" field is open-ended, providing unique identifiers for each clinician.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the integration of functions score for Clinician 55?
</task>","The critical values and ranges in the table relate to respondent names, their assigned groups (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and various Likert scale scores (1-5) indicating agreement or disagreement with statements about system usage, complexity, ease of use, technical support needs, function integration, inconsistency, ease of learning, cumbersomeness, confidence, and learning requirements. Specifically, the ""Integration of Functions"" score is a Likert scale value ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), indicating how well the respondent found the system's functions integrated.

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the confidence in use score for Clinician 42?
</task>","The critical values and ranges in the table relate to respondent demographics and their perceptions of a system. The `pred:Group` field categorizes respondents into ""A. Senior"", ""B. Junior"", ""C. Middle"", and ""D. Intern"". Various Likert scale questions, ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), measure aspects like `Frequent_Usage`, `System_Complexity`, `Ease_of_Use`, `Need_for_Technical_Support`, `Integration_of_Functions`, `Inconsistency`, `Ease_of_Learning`, `Cumbersome_to_Use`, `Confidence_in_Use`, and `Need_to_Learn_Before_Use`. These scores indicate the degree of agreement or disagreement with the statements, providing insights into user experience.

<task>
What is the need for technical support score for Clinician 47?
</task>","The critical values and ranges in the table relate to respondent demographics and their perceptions of a system's usability. The `Group` field categorizes respondents into Senior, Junior, Middle, or Intern roles. Usability aspects like `Frequent_Usage`, `System_Complexity`, `Ease_of_Use`, `Need_for_Technical_Support`, `Integration_of_Functions`, `Inconsistency`, `Ease_of_Learning`, `Cumbersome_to_Use`, `Confidence_in_Use`, and `Need_to_Learn_Before_Use` are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Lower scores for negative attributes (e.g., `System_Complexity`, `Inconsistency`, `Cumbersome_to_Use`, `Need_to_Learn_Before_Use`) and higher scores for positive attributes (e.g., `Frequent_Usage`, `Ease_of_Use`, `Integration_of_Functions`, `Ease_of_Learning`, `Confidence_in_Use`) generally indicate a more positive user experience.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<task>
What is the system complexity score for Clinician 63?
</task>","The `pred:Group` field is a categorical variable with options A (Senior), B (Junior), C (Middle), and D (Intern). All other survey questions, such as `pred:System_Complexity`, are measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 typically indicates strong disagreement or a positive attribute (e.g., not complex) and 5 indicates strong agreement or a negative attribute (e.g., very complex). The specific question for system complexity indicates that a score of 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (not complex) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (very complex). The task requires extracting a specific numerical value from this Likert scale.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the need for technical support score for Clinician 22?
</task>","The critical values and ranges in the table relate to respondent names, their group affiliations (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern), and their Likert scale responses (1-5) to various system usability questions. The Likert scale ranges from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) for most questions, indicating levels of agreement or disagreement with statements about system usage, complexity, ease, and confidence. Specifically, the ""Need for Technical Support"" question uses this 1-5 scale, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (no need for support) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (strong need for support).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the frequent usage score for Clinician 53?
</task>","The critical values for the 'Frequent_Usage' score range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), indicating the respondent's inclination to use the system frequently. 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' are also Likert scales (1-5), where lower scores for complexity and higher scores for ease of use generally indicate a more positive user experience. The 'Group' field is a categorical variable (A, B, C, D) representing different respondent classifications (Senior, Junior, Middle, Intern). Other Likert scale questions like 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Confidence_in_Use' provide insights into perceived system support requirements and user self-assurance.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
