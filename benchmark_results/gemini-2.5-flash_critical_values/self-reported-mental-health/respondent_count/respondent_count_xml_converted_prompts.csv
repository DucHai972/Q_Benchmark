<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents are there?
</task>","Critical values and ranges in the table relate to various aspects of the respondents' lives. For instance, 'Year of birth' ranges from 2001.0 to 2004.0, indicating a young demographic. 'Socio-economic status' varies from 1.0 (Very low) to 5.0, showing a spread across different economic backgrounds. Emotional states, such as 'Life satisfaction', 'Happiness', 'Laughter', 'Learning', and 'Enjoyment', are rated on a 0-10 scale, with responses covering a wide spectrum from 2.0 to 10.0. Conversely, negative emotions like 'Worry', 'Depression', 'Anger', 'Stress', and 'Loneliness' also show varied responses, with some respondents reporting 0.0 (at no time) and others as high as 10.0 (all the time) for loneliness.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","Critical values and ranges in the table indicate that the questionnaire collects demographic information such as year of birth, gender, socio-economic status (Likert 1-6), and ethnic identity (MCQ with 6 options). It also gathers data on life satisfaction and daily emotional states (Likert 0-10 for happiness, laughter, learning, enjoyment, worry, depression, anger, stress, loneliness). Additionally, there are two question groups for emotional regulation frequency (Likert 0-4) and anxiety/depressive symptoms frequency (Likert 0-3), each containing multiple sub-questions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are there?
</task>","The dataset includes 8 respondents with birth years ranging from 2002 to 2005, and a mix of genders, though most are male. Socio-economic status varies from very low (1.0) to high (5.0), with all respondents identifying as 'None of the above' for ethnic identity. Parental education levels show a broad range, with fathers having between 11 and 25 years of education, and mothers between 11 and 22 years. Life satisfaction and various daily emotional states (happiness, laughter, worry, depression, etc.) are measured on a 0-10 Likert scale, showing diverse individual experiences. Emotional regulation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms are assessed using specific Likert scales (0-4 and 0-3), indicating varying frequencies of these experiences among the respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents are there?
</task>","Critical values and ranges in the table relate to various aspects of the respondents' lives. For instance, 'Year of birth' ranges from 2002.0 to 2005.0, indicating a young demographic. 'Socio-economic status' varies from 2.0 to 5.0 on a 1-6 Likert scale, suggesting a range from low to high status. Emotional states like 'Happiness', 'Laughter', and 'Enjoyment' show a wide range of scores (0.0-9.0 or 10.0), indicating diverse daily experiences. Similarly, negative emotions such as 'Worry', 'Depression', 'Anger', 'Stress', and 'Loneliness' also exhibit varied responses, with some respondents reporting high levels (e.g., 'Loneliness' up to 10.0). The frequency of emotional regulation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms are measured on Likert scales (0-4 and 0-3), showing individual differences in mental well-being.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are there?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from 9 unique individuals. Each respondent is identified by a distinct ID, with the IDs ranging from 6 to 150. The questionnaire covers a broad range of topics, including demographics, life satisfaction, daily emotional states, and detailed frequencies of emotional regulation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Responses for various questions are provided using different Likert scales (e.g., 0-10, 0-4, 0-3) or as open-ended numerical values. Some respondents have provided answers for all sub-questions within a group, while others have not.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are there?
</task>","Critical values and ranges of the table related:
The dataset contains responses from multiple individuals, each identified by a unique `respondent id`. The `questions` section defines various types of questions, including open-ended (e.g., ""Year of birth""), multiple-choice (e.g., ""Gender"", ""Ethnic identity""), and Likert scales with specific ranges (e.g., ""Life satisfaction"" 0-10, ""Socio-economic status"" 1-6, ""Emotional Regulation Frequency"" 0-4, ""Anxiety Symptoms Frequency"" 0-3, ""Depressive Symptoms Frequency"" 0-3). Some questions are grouped, such as ""Parental Education"" with sub-questions for ""Father"" and ""Mother"", and various emotional frequency scales with multiple sub-questions. The `responses` section provides the answers for each respondent, adhering to the question types and scales defined in the `questions` section.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents are there?
</task>","Critical values and ranges in the table indicate that respondent IDs are unique identifiers for each participant. The 'Year of birth' ranges from 2002 to 2005, suggesting a young adult or adolescent demographic. 'Socio-economic status' varies between 4 and 5 on a 1-6 Likert scale, indicating a relatively higher status. 'Life satisfaction', 'Happiness', 'Laughter', 'Learning', and 'Enjoyment' are generally high (5-10 on a 0-10 scale), while 'Worry', 'Depression', 'Anger', and 'Stress' are low (0-3 on a 0-10 scale). Emotional regulation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms are mostly in the lower range of their respective Likert scales (0-4 and 0-3), suggesting infrequent or mild experiences of these issues.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents are there?
</task>","Critical values and ranges in this table relate to the number of respondents. The primary critical value is the count of unique respondent IDs. The range for respondent IDs is from 9 to 127. Each respondent entry contains answers to various questions, including demographic information like year of birth, gender, socio-economic status, and ethnic identity. Additionally, there are responses to questions about life satisfaction, happiness, emotional states, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, often using Likert scales with specific ranges (e.g., 0-10, 0-4, 0-3).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents are there?
</task>","Critical values and ranges in the table relate to various aspects of a respondent's life and well-being. The 'Year of birth' is an open-ended field, while 'Gender' is a multiple-choice question with options for Male and Female. 'Socio-economic status' is a Likert scale from 1 (Very low) to 6 (Very high). Emotional and mental health questions, such as 'Life satisfaction', 'Happiness', 'Worry', 'Depression', 'Anger', 'Stress', and 'Loneliness', are generally rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 10. Frequency of emotional regulation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms are measured on different Likert scales, typically 0-4 or 0-3, indicating how often certain feelings or problems were experienced.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
