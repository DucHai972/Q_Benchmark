<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- The field pred:SessionName is an open-ended text field asking ""What is the name of the session? [Open-ended]"".  
- Respondent3's data includes pred:SessionName with the value ""IV-Hypoglycemia"".  
- Other fields such as Identification, Situation, Background_history, etc., have rubric scores from 0 to 3, but these are not relevant to the session name.  
- The session name values vary and are free text, e.g., ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", ""IV (VT)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the date for respondent 15?
</task>","The critical values related to the date field are found under the question :QDate, which asks ""What is the date of the session? [Open-ended]"". This means the date is recorded as a free text string representing the session date. In the responses, the date values are formatted as ""YYYY-MM-DD"". For respondent 15, the date is explicitly given as ""2025-05-04"". This is a direct open-ended text value, so no mapping or interpretation is needed beyond reading the exact string.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the session name for respondent 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- The session name is an open-ended text field asking ""What is the name of the session?""  
- Respondent 5's data includes a pred:SessionName field with the value ""(MI)-VT"".  
- Other respondents have session names formatted similarly as text strings.  
- No code mapping is needed since session names are open-ended text.  
- The session name should be output exactly as given in the response data.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

For respondent 22, the date is given explicitly as ""2025-05-16"". This is consistent with the format and range of other respondents' dates, which fall within the year 2025.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 19?
</task>","The identification score is based on the question :QIdentification, which asks: ""Identification of self, role, and patient."" The rubric for scoring is as follows:
0 = Requires direct prompting
1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint
2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete
3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

What is the global rating score for respondent 18?
</task>","The global rating score corresponds to the question :QRecommendation_global_rating_scale, which asks: ""Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]"".

For respondent 18, the value for pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""2"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
