<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the date for respondent 15?
</task>","The critical values related to the question ""What is the date for respondent 15?"" are found in the ""Date"" question field within the questions schema, which is an open-ended field asking ""What is the date of the session?"" The responses section contains individual respondent data, each with an ""answer"" element for the ""Date"" question. Respondent 15's data includes a ""Date"" answer, which is the value to be extracted directly as an open-ended text field.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The ""SessionName"" question is an open-ended field asking for the name of the session. Respondent IDs are numeric identifiers for each respondent. The ""SessionName"" values vary and are free text, such as ""(MI)-VT"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", and ""III-Sepsis"". Respondent 5's data includes a session name recorded as ""(MI)-VT"". This field does not have predefined options, so the exact text from the response should be used.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the session name are as follows: The ""SessionName"" question is an open-ended field asking ""What is the name of the session?"" with no predefined options, so the response is a free text string. Respondent IDs are unique identifiers for each respondent. Respondent 4's data includes a session name recorded as ""I-VF"". Other respondents have session names like ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""MI"", showing that session names can include Roman numerals, abbreviations, and parentheses. The session name is directly taken from the respondent's answer without any code mapping.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the date for respondent 16?
</task>","The critical values related to the date field are open-ended text values representing the date of the session in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The date is provided as a direct text answer for each respondent. Respondent IDs are unique identifiers for each respondent, and the date is associated with each respondent's session. The date values in the responses are consistent with the question schema and are straightforward to extract.
