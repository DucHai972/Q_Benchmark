<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?"" are found in the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field. According to the rubric, the scores mean:
- 0 = No recommendation
- 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning
- 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning
- 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning

A ""good recommendation score (2)"" specifically refers to a score of 2 in this field.

From the responses:
- Respondent 11 has a recommendation score of 3.
- Respondent 16 has a recommendation score of 2.
- Respondent 18 has a recommendation score of 3.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify here is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment ability of the respondent. According to the rubric, a score of 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning,"" which is considered a good clinical assessment score. The possible scores range from 0 (no logical assessment) to 3 (comprehensive logical assessment without questioning). We need to find the respondent(s) with an Assessment score exactly equal to 2.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value here is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment ability of the respondent. According to the rubric, a score of 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning,"" which qualifies as a good clinical assessment score. The possible scores range from 0 (no logical assessment) to 3 (comprehensive logical assessment without questioning). Among the respondents, only respondent 11 has an Assessment score of 2, while the others have scores of 3.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" question uses a rubric where 1 means ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed."" The possible scores range from 0 to 3, with 1 indicating a moderate level of performance, specifically that observations are reported but require frequent clarification.

Looking at the responses:
- Respondent 19 has a score of 3 for Background (examination).
- Respondent 10 has a score of 2 for Background (examination).
- Respondent 4 has a score of 1 for Background (examination).

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate background examination score (1) is respondent 4.

0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" question uses the rubric:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

A moderate score of 1 means the respondent reported observations but frequent clarification was needed.

Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 23 has a Background (examination) score of 1  
- Respondent 6 has a score of 3  
- Respondent 12 has a score of -1 (not valid or missing)

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate background examination score (1) is respondent 23.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The ""Situation"" question rubric defines scores as follows:  
0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)  
1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting  
2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed  
3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted  

A ""good"" situation score (2) means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 11 has Situation = 3  
- Respondent 20 has Situation = 3  
- Respondent 7 has Situation = 2  

Only respondent 7 has a situation score of 2.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""moderate recommendation score (1)"" are found in the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field. According to the rubric, the scores mean:
- 0 = No recommendation
- 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning
- 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning
- 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning

A moderate recommendation score of 1 indicates the respondent made a clear recommendation but only after extended questioning.

From the responses:
- Respondent 3 has a recommendation score of 1.
- Respondent 4 has a recommendation score of 2.
- Respondent 23 has a recommendation score of 3.

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate recommendation score (1) is respondent 3.

Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" question uses a rubric where 1 means ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed,"" which is considered a moderate score between 0 (omitted or irrelevant) and higher scores indicating better performance.

Among the respondents:
- Respondent 4 has a Background (examination) score of 1.
- Respondent 9 has a score of 3.
- Respondent 6 has a score of 3.

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate background examination score (1) is respondent 4.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify a good clinical assessment score is the ""Assessment"" field, which is scored as follows:  
0 = No logical assessment  
1 = Assessment only after extended questioning  
2 = Assessment after minimal questioning  
3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning  

A good clinical assessment score is defined as 2. Among the respondents, we look for those with an ""Assessment"" score of 2.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The ""Background (history)"" question is scored as follows:  
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant  
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused history  

A ""good"" background history score of 2 means the respondent gave relevant history with few further questions needed.

Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 18 has a score of 3 (comprehensive focused history)  
- Respondent 20 has a score of 3 (comprehensive focused history)  
- Respondent 15 has a score of 2 (relevant history with few further questions needed)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The ""Situation"" question rubric defines the scores as follows:
- 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)
- 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting
- 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed
- 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

Looking at the responses:
- Respondent 1 has Situation = 3
- Respondent 8 has Situation = 3
- Respondent 7 has Situation = 2

Only respondent 7 has a situation score of 2.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value here is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment ability of the respondent. According to the rubric, a score of 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning,"" which is considered a good clinical assessment score. The possible scores range from 0 (no logical assessment) to 3 (comprehensive logical assessment without questioning). Among the respondents, only those with an ""Assessment"" score exactly equal to 2 meet the criterion of a good clinical assessment score.

Respondent 15 has an Assessment score of 2.  
Respondent 19 has an Assessment score of 3.  
Respondent 12 has an Assessment score of 3.

0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant

A moderate score here is 1, meaning observations are reported but frequent clarification is needed.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The ""Situation"" question rubric defines scores as follows:  
0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)  
1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting  
2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed  
3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted  

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 2 has Situation = 3  
- Respondent 22 has Situation = 3  
- Respondent 14 has Situation = 2  

Only respondent 14 has a situation score of 2.

Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field uses the rubric:  
0 = No recommendation  
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning  
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning  
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning  

We are looking for a respondent with a recommendation score of 1, which means they made a clear recommendation only after extended questioning.

Reviewing the responses:  
- Respondent 6 has a recommendation score of 3  
- Respondent 10 has a recommendation score of 2  
- Respondent 3 has a recommendation score of 1  

Therefore, respondent 3 has a moderate recommendation score (1).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The ""Situation"" question rubric defines scores as follows:  
0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)  
1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting  
2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed  
3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted  

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 12 has Situation = 3  
- Respondent 18 has Situation = 3  
- Respondent 14 has Situation = 2  

Only respondent 14 has a situation score of 2.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" question uses a rubric with scores from 0 to 3, where 1 means ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed."" The responses show the following scores for ""Background (examination)"":

- Respondent 12: -1 (which is outside the rubric range, likely invalid or missing)
- Respondent 4: 1 (matches the moderate score defined)
- Respondent 20: 2 (higher than moderate)

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate background examination score (1) is respondent 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The ""Background (history)"" question is scored as follows:  
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant  
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused history  

A good background history score of 2 means the respondent gave relevant history with few further questions needed.

Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 22 has a Background (history) score of 3  
- Respondent 11 has a Background (history) score of 3  
- Respondent 17 has a Background (history) score of 2  

Only respondent 17 has a background history score of 2.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The critical values related to the question ""good background history score (2)"" come from the ""Background (history)"" rubric in the questions section. The rubric defines scores as follows:  
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant  
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused history  

A ""good"" background history score of 2 means the respondent gave relevant history with few further questions needed.  

Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 10 has Background (history) = 3  
- Respondent 20 has Background (history) = 3  
- Respondent 12 has Background (history) = 2  

Only respondent 12 has a background history score of 2, which matches the ""good"" score requested.

Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The ""Background (history)"" question rubric defines the scores as follows:
- 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant
- 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed
- 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed
- 3 = Comprehensive focused history

A ""good"" background history score of 2 means the respondent gave relevant history with few further questions needed.

Looking at the responses:
- Respondent 19 has a score of 3 (higher than 2)
- Respondent 18 has a score of 3 (higher than 2)
- Respondent 12 has a score of 2 (exactly 2)

Therefore, respondent 12 has a good background history score of 2.
