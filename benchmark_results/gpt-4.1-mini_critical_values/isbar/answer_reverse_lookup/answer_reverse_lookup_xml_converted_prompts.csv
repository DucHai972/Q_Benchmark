<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify here is the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" score, which is rated on a rubric from 0 to 3. A score of 2 means ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning,"" which is considered a good recommendation score. Among the respondents, we need to find who has this score of 2 in the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field. The other scores and fields are not directly relevant to this question.

Respondent 11 has a recommendation score of 3.  
Respondent 16 has a recommendation score of 2.  
Respondent 18 has a recommendation score of 3.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment quality. According to the schema, the ""Assessment"" rubric is:  
0 = No logical assessment  
1 = Assessment only after extended questioning  
2 = Assessment after minimal questioning  
3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning  

A ""good clinical assessment score (2)"" means the respondent made an assessment after minimal questioning. Among the respondents, we look for those with an ""Assessment"" score of 2.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 12 has Assessment = 3  
- Respondent 15 has Assessment = 2  
- Respondent 19 has Assessment = 3  

Only respondent 15 has an Assessment score of 2.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment quality with the rubric:  
0 = No logical assessment  
1 = Assessment only after extended questioning  
2 = Assessment after minimal questioning  
3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning  

A ""good clinical assessment score (2)"" means the respondent's ""Assessment"" answer must be exactly 2.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 11 has Assessment = 2  
- Respondent 17 has Assessment = 3  
- Respondent 2 has Assessment = 3  

Only respondent 11 has an Assessment score of 2.

- 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
- 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
- 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
- 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

The score of interest is 1, which indicates that observations were reported but frequent clarification was needed. Among the respondents, we need to identify who has a score of 1 for ""Background (examination)"".

From the responses:

- Respondent 19 has a score of 3 for Background (examination)  
- Respondent 10 has a score of 2 for Background (examination)  
- Respondent 4 has a score of 1 for Background (examination)

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

A ""good"" score of 2 means the respondent reported observations with few further questions needed.

Looking at the respondents' ""Background (examination)"" scores:

- 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)
- 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting
- 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed
- 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the ""Background (examination)"" question are as follows:  
- 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
- 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
- 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
- 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

Among the respondents, the scores for ""Background (examination)"" are:  
- Respondent 23: 1  
- Respondent 6: 3  
- Respondent 12: -1 (which is outside the rubric and likely invalid or missing)  

The moderate score of 1 corresponds to ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed.""

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The ""Situation"" question rubric defines the scores as follows:
- 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)
- 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting
- 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed
- 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

Looking at the respondents' ""Situation"" scores:
- Respondent 11: 3
- Respondent 7: 2
- Respondent 22: 3

Only respondent 7 has a situation score of 2.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?"" focus on the question ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" which is scored as follows:  
0 = No recommendation  
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning  
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning  
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning  

We need to identify respondents with a score of 1 in this field.  
From the responses:  
- Respondent 3 has a recommendation score of 1.  
- Respondent 4 has a recommendation score of 2.  
- Respondent 23 has a recommendation score of 3.  

Only respondent 3 has a moderate recommendation score (1).

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify here is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment quality with the rubric:  
0 = No logical assessment  
1 = Assessment only after extended questioning  
2 = Assessment after minimal questioning  
3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning  

A ""good clinical assessment score (2)"" means the respondent's ""Assessment"" answer should be exactly 2.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 6 has Assessment = 3  
- Respondent 8 has Assessment = 3  
- Respondent 7 has Assessment = 2  

Therefore, the respondent with a good clinical assessment score (2) is respondent 7.

0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant  
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused history  

A ""good"" background history score of 2 means the respondent gave relevant history with few further questions needed.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The critical values related to the question ""Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?"" come from the question ""Background (examination)"" which is scored as follows:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

We need to find the respondent(s) with a score of 1 in ""Background (examination)"".  
Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 23 has a ""Background (examination)"" score of 1.  
- Respondent 17 has a score of 2.  
- Respondent 15 has a score of 3.  

Only respondent 23 has the moderate score of 1 for background examination.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the Identification question are as follows:  
The Identification question rubric scores range from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting,"" indicating a poor identification score. Scores 1 to 3 indicate progressively better performance, with 3 being ""Introduces themselves and information is complete.""  
In the responses, Identification scores are given as integers corresponding to these rubric levels.  
A poor identification score is specifically 0, meaning the respondent needed direct prompting to identify self, role, and patient.  
Among the respondents, only respondent 5 has an Identification score of 0.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""moderate recommendation score (1)"" are found in the question ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"". According to the rubric, the scores mean:

- 0 = No recommendation
- 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning
- 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning
- 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning

A moderate recommendation score of 1 indicates the respondent made a clear recommendation but only after extended questioning.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 3 has a ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" score of 1.
- Respondent 11 has a score of 3.
- Respondent 10 has a score of 2.

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate recommendation score (1) is respondent 3.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" question uses the rubric:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

A moderate score of 1 means the respondent reported observations but frequent clarification was needed.

Looking at the respondents' ""Background (examination)"" scores:  
- Respondent 4: 1  
- Respondent 20: 2  
- Respondent 17: 2

Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The ""Situation"" question rubric defines the scores as follows:
- 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)
- 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting
- 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed
- 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

Looking at the respondents' ""Situation"" scores:
- Respondent 1: Situation = 3
- Respondent 8: Situation = 3
- Respondent 7: Situation = 2

Only respondent 7 has a situation score of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify here is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment ability of the respondent. According to the rubric, a score of 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning,"" which is considered a good clinical assessment score. The possible scores range from 0 to 3, with 0 being no logical assessment and 3 being a comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. Among the respondents, we need to find those with an ""Assessment"" score exactly equal to 2.

Respondent 15 has an Assessment score of 2.  
Respondent 19 has an Assessment score of 3.  
Respondent 12 has an Assessment score of 3.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)  
1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting  
2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed  
3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted  

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

Reviewing the respondents' ""Situation"" scores:  
- Respondent 2: Situation = 3

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" question rubric defines the scores as follows:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

A moderate score of 1 means the respondent reported observations but frequent clarification was needed.

Looking at the respondents' ""Background (examination)"" scores:  
- Respondent 1: 3  
- Respondent 20: 2  
- Respondent 4: 1

0 = No recommendation  
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning  
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning  
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning  

We need to identify respondents with a score of 1 in this field.  
From the responses:  
- Respondent 6 has a score of 3

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The question ""Background (examination)"" is scored as follows:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

We are asked to find the respondent with a moderate background examination score of 1, which means ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed.""

Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 4 has Background (examination) = 1  
- Respondent 21 has Background (examination) = 2  
- Respondent 15 has Background (examination) = 3  

Only respondent 4 has a score of 1 for Background (examination).

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The ""Situation"" question rubric defines the scores as follows:
- 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)
- 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting
- 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed
- 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

Looking at the respondents' ""Situation"" scores:
- Respondent 12: Situation = 3
- Respondent 18: Situation = 3
- Respondent 14: Situation = 2

Only respondent 14 has a situation score of 2.

Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the identification score are defined in the questions schema as follows:  
Identification of self, role, and patient is scored from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting,"" 1 means ""Introduces themselves but only after a hint,"" 2 means ""Introduces themselves but information is incomplete,"" and 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete.""  
A poor identification score is specifically 0, indicating the respondent requires direct prompting to identify self, role, and patient.  
Among the respondents, only respondent 5 has an identification score of 0.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

0 = Requires direct prompting  
1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint  
2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete  
3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete  

Looking at the respondents' Identification scores:  
- Respondent 21: 3  
- Respondent 22: 3  
- Respondent 9: 2  

Only respondent 9 has an Identification score of 2, which corresponds to ""Introduces themselves but information is incomplete.""

- 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
- 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
- 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
- 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

We are looking for a respondent with a score of 1 in ""Background (examination)"". Reviewing the responses:

- Respondent 12 has a score of -1 (not valid or outside rubric)  
- Respondent 4 has a score of 1  
- Respondent 20 has a score of 2

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

0 = Requires direct prompting (poor score)  
1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint  
2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete  
3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete  

Looking at the respondents:  
- Respondent 5 has Identification = 0

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The critical values related to the recommendation score are found under the question ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" with the rubric:  
0 = No recommendation  
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning  
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning  
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning  

A moderate recommendation score corresponds to the value 1, meaning the respondent made a clear recommendation only after extended questioning.  

Among the respondents:  
- Respondent 3 has a recommendation score of 1.  
- Respondent 1 has a recommendation score of 2.  
- Respondent 13 has a recommendation score of 2.  

Therefore, only respondent 3 has a moderate recommendation score (1).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The critical value here is the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" score, which is rated on a rubric from 0 to 3. According to the schema, a score of 1 means ""Clear recommendation only after extended questioning,"" which corresponds to a moderate recommendation score. Among the respondents, we need to identify who has a score of 1 in this field.

Reviewing the responses:
- Respondent 22 has a recommendation score of 2.
- Respondent 3 has a recommendation score of 1.
- Respondent 11 has a recommendation score of 3.

Only respondent 3 has a moderate recommendation score (1).

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The Identification question rubric defines scores from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"" (poor identification), and higher scores indicate better identification performance.

Among the respondents:
- Respondent 20 has Identification score 3.
- Respondent 7 has Identification score 3.
- Respondent 5 has Identification score 0.

Therefore, respondent 5 has a poor identification score (0).

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The ""Background (history)"" question rubric defines the scores as follows:  
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant  
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused history  

A good background history score of 2 means the respondent gave relevant history with few further questions needed.

Looking at the respondents:  
- Respondent 22 has a score of 3 for Background (history)  
- Respondent 11 has a score of 3 for Background (history)  
- Respondent 17 has a score of 2 for Background (history)  

Only respondent 17 has a background history score of 2.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The critical values related to the question ""Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?"" come from the question ""Background (examination)"" which is scored as follows:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

In the responses, the ""Background (examination)"" scores are:  
- Respondent 15: 3  
- Respondent 23: 1  
- Respondent 11: 3  

Only respondent 23 has a score of 1, which corresponds to ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed,"" matching the moderate score requested.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" question rubric defines the scores as follows:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

A moderate score of 1 means the respondent reported observations but required frequent clarification.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 9 has a score of 3 for Background (examination)  
- Respondent 4 has a score of 1 for Background (examination)  
- Respondent 20 has a score of 2 for Background (examination)  

Only respondent 4 has a moderate background examination score of 1.

A ""good"" background history score of 2 means the respondent gave relevant history with few further questions needed.

Looking at the respondents' ""Background (history)"" scores:
