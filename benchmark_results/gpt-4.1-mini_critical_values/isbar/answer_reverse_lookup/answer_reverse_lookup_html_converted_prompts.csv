<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""good recommendation score (2)"" are found under the field ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" in the schema. The rubric for this field is:  
0 = No recommendation  
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning  
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning  
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning  

A ""good"" recommendation score here is defined as 2, meaning the respondent made a clear recommendation after minimal questioning.  

From the responses:  
- Respondent 11 has a recommendation score of 3  
- Respondent 16 has a recommendation score of 2  
- Respondent 18 has a recommendation score of 3  

Only Respondent 16 has a recommendation score of 2.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify here is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment quality. According to the rubric, a score of 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning,"" which qualifies as a good clinical assessment score. The possible scores range from 0 (no logical assessment) to 3 (comprehensive logical assessment without questioning). We need to find respondents with an Assessment score exactly equal to 2.

From the responses:
- Respondent 12 has Assessment: 3
- Respondent 15 has Assessment: 2
- Respondent 19 has Assessment: 3

Only Respondent 15 has an Assessment score of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""moderate recommendation score (1)"" are found in the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field. According to the schema, the rubric for this field is:  
0 = No recommendation  
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning  
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning  
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning  

Thus, a moderate recommendation score of 1 means the respondent made a clear recommendation but only after extended questioning. In the responses, the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" scores are:  
- Respondent 3: 1  
- Respondent 20: 2  
- Respondent 21: 3  

Only Respondent 3 has a recommendation score of 1.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify a good clinical assessment score is the ""Assessment"" field, which is scored as follows:  
0 = No logical assessment  
1 = Assessment only after extended questioning  
2 = Assessment after minimal questioning  
3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning  

A ""good"" clinical assessment score is defined as 2. Among the respondents, we look for those with an Assessment score of 2.  

Reviewing the responses:  
- Respondent 11 has an Assessment score of 2.  
- Respondent 17 has an Assessment score of 3.  
- Respondent 2 has an Assessment score of 3.  

Only Respondent 11 has a clinical assessment score of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" field is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, where 0 means observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 means observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 means observations reported with few further questions needed, and 3 means comprehensive focused examination/observations. A moderate score here corresponds to 1, indicating observations were reported but frequent clarification was needed.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 19 has a score of 3 for Background (examination).
- Respondent 10 has a score of 2 for Background (examination).
- Respondent 4 has a score of 1 for Background (examination).

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate background examination score (1) is Respondent 4.

<task>
Which respondent has a good background examination score (2)?
</task>","The critical values for ""Background (examination)"" are scored from 0 to 3, where 0 means observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 means observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 means observations reported with few further questions needed, and 3 means comprehensive focused examination/observations. A ""good"" score of 2 indicates that the respondent reported observations with few further questions needed, which is a positive but not the highest rating. Among the respondents, we need to identify who scored exactly 2 in this category.

Respondent 20 has a ""Background (examination)"" score of 2. Respondents 11 and 19 have scores of 3, which is higher than 2.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" field is scored from 0 to 3, where 0 means observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 means observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 means observations reported with few further questions needed, and 3 means comprehensive focused examination/observations. A moderate score here is 1, indicating observations are reported but frequent clarification is needed. Among the respondents, only Respondent 23 has a ""Background (examination)"" score of 1. Respondent 6 has 3, Respondent 12 has -1 (which is invalid or missing), and Respondent 23 has 1.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify a good clinical assessment score is the ""Assessment"" field, which is scored as follows:  
0 = No logical assessment  
1 = Assessment only after extended questioning  
2 = Assessment after minimal questioning  
3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning  

A ""good"" clinical assessment score is defined as 2. Among the respondents, we look for those with an Assessment score of 2.  

From the responses:  
- Respondent 6 has Assessment = 3  
- Respondent 8 has Assessment = 3  
- Respondent 7 has Assessment = 2  

Therefore, Respondent 7 has a good clinical assessment score (2).

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The critical values related to the question ""good background history score (2)"" come from the ""Background (history)"" field. According to the schema, the scoring rubric for Background (history) is:  
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant  
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused history  

A ""good"" background history score of 2 means the respondent gave relevant history with few further questions needed. Among the respondents, we need to identify who scored exactly 2 in this field.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 12 has Background (history) = 2  
- Respondent 20 has Background (history) = 3  
- Respondent 16 has Background (history) = 3  

Only Respondent 12 has a Background (history) score of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The Identification field is scored as follows:  
0 = Requires direct prompting  
1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint  
2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete  
3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete  

A poor identification score is 0, meaning the respondent requires direct prompting to identify self, role, and patient.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 5 has Identification = 0  
- Respondent 12 has Identification = 3  
- Respondent 23 has Identification = 3

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The critical values related to the ""Background (history)"" field are defined in the rubric as follows:  
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant  
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused history  

A ""good"" background history score of 2 means the respondent gave relevant history with few further questions needed.  

From the responses:  
- Respondent 18 has a Background (history) score of 3  
- Respondent 20 has a Background (history) score of 3

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The critical values related to the question ""moderate background examination score (1)"" come from the ""Background (examination)"" field. According to the schema, the rubric for this field is:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

A score of 1 indicates a moderate level where observations are reported but frequent clarification is needed. Among the respondents, we need to identify who has a ""Background (examination)"" score of 1.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 4 has a Background (examination) score of 1  
- Respondent 20 has a score of 2  
- Respondent 17 has a score of 2  

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate background examination score (1) is Respondent 4.

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The ""Situation"" field rubric defines scores as follows:  
0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)  
1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting  
2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed  
3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted  

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 1 has Situation: 3  
- Respondent 8 has Situation: 3

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value to identify here is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment ability of the respondent. According to the rubric, a score of 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning,"" which qualifies as a good clinical assessment score. The possible scores range from 0 to 3, with 0 being no logical assessment and 3 being a comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. Among the respondents, we need to find those with an Assessment score exactly equal to 2.

Respondent 15 has an Assessment score of 2.  
Respondent 19 has an Assessment score of 3.  
Respondent 12 has an Assessment score of 3.

Therefore, the respondent with a good clinical assessment score (2) is:

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" field is scored from 0 to 3, where 0 means observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 means observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 means observations reported with few further questions needed, and 3 means comprehensive focused examination/observations. A moderate score of 1 indicates that observations were reported but frequent clarification was needed. Among the respondents, only Respondent 4 has a ""Background (examination)"" score of 1. Respondent 6 and 8 have scores of 3, which is the highest, and thus not moderate.

0 = Requires direct prompting  
1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint  
2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete  
3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete  

A poor identification score is 0, meaning the respondent requires direct prompting to identify self, role, and patient.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 14 has Identification: 3  
- Respondent 6 has Identification: -1 (not in rubric, likely invalid or missing)

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The critical values related to the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" field are defined by the rubric:  
0 = No recommendation  
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning  
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning  
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning  

A moderate recommendation score corresponds to the value 1, meaning the respondent made a clear recommendation only after extended questioning.  

From the responses:  
- Respondent 3 has a recommendation score of 1.  
- Respondent 20 has a recommendation score of 2.  
- Respondent 21 has a recommendation score of 3.  

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate recommendation score (1) is Respondent 3.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The critical values related to the ""Background (examination)"" field are scores from 0 to 3, where 0 means observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 means observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 means observations reported with few further questions needed, and 3 means comprehensive focused examination/observations. A moderate score in this context corresponds to 1, indicating observations were reported but frequent clarification was needed. Among the respondents, only Respondent 4 has a ""Background (examination)"" score of 1. The other respondents have scores of 2 or 3 in this field.

0 = No recommendation  
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning  
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning  
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning  

Looking at the respondents:  
- Respondent 6 has a score of 3

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The critical values related to the question ""Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?"" are found in the ""Background (examination)"" field. According to the schema, the rubric for this field is:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

A score of 1 indicates a moderate level of performance where observations are reported but require frequent clarification. Among the respondents, only Respondent 4 has a ""Background (examination)"" score of 1. Respondents 21 and 15 have scores of 2 and 3 respectively, which are higher than 1.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The ""Situation"" question rubric defines scores as follows:  
0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)  
1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting  
2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed  
3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted  

A ""good"" situation score of 2 means the respondent identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed.

Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 12 has Situation: 3  
- Respondent 18 has Situation: 3  
- Respondent 14 has Situation: 2  

Only Respondent 14 has a situation score of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The Identification score rubric ranges from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"" and higher scores indicate better self-identification and information completeness. A poor identification score is specifically 0, indicating the respondent needed direct prompting to identify self, role, and patient. Among the respondents, only Respondent 5 has an Identification score of 0.

<task>
Which respondent has a good identification score (2)?
</task>","The Identification field rubric is:  
0 = Requires direct prompting  
1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint  
2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete  
3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete  

A good identification score of 2 means the respondent introduces themselves but the information is incomplete.

Looking at the responses:  
- Respondent 21: Identification = 3  
- Respondent 22: Identification = 3  
- Respondent 9: Identification = 2  

Only Respondent 9 has an Identification score of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The critical values for the ""Background (examination)"" field are defined as follows:  
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant  
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations  

In the responses, the ""Background (examination)"" scores are:  
- Respondent 12: -1 (which is outside the defined rubric, possibly an error or missing data)  
- Respondent 4: 1 (matches the moderate score defined as ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"")  
- Respondent 20: 2  

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate background examination score (1) is Respondent 4.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The critical value to identify here is the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" score, which is rated on a rubric from 0 to 3. A score of 1 means ""Clear recommendation only after extended questioning,"" which corresponds to a moderate recommendation score. Among the respondents, we need to find who has a recommendation score of 1. The other scores range from 0 (no recommendation) to 3 (clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning). The respondents' recommendation scores are: Respondent 16 has 2, Respondent 3 has 1, and Respondent 18 has 3. Therefore, the respondent with a moderate recommendation score (1) is Respondent 3.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The critical values related to the identification score are defined in the rubric as follows: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete. The identification score ranges from 0 to 3, where 0 indicates the poorest performance in identification. Among the respondents, only Respondent 5 has an identification score of 0, indicating they require direct prompting to identify themselves, their role, and the patient.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The critical values for the Identification field range from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"" and 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete."" A poor identification score is specifically 0, indicating the respondent needed direct prompting to identify self, role, and patient. Among the respondents, only Respondent 5 has an Identification score of 0.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The Identification score ranges from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"" and 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete."" A poor identification score is 0, indicating the respondent needed direct prompting to identify self, role, and patient. Among the respondents, only Respondent 5 has an Identification score of 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The ""Background (examination)"" field is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, where 0 means observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 means observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 means observations reported with few further questions needed, and 3 means comprehensive focused examination/observations. A moderate score of 1 indicates that observations were reported but frequent clarification was needed.

Among the respondents:
- Respondent 9 has a score of 3 for Background (examination).
- Respondent 4 has a score of 1 for Background (examination).
- Respondent 20 has a score of 2 for Background (examination).

Therefore, the respondent with a moderate background examination score (1) is Respondent 4.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The critical values related to the background history score are defined in the rubric as follows:  
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant  
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed  
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed  
3 = Comprehensive focused history  

A ""good"" background history score is indicated as 2 or above, meaning the respondent provides relevant history with few or no further questions needed.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 18 has a background history score of 3.  
- Respondent 2 has a background history score of 2.  
- Respondent 10 has a background history score of 3.  

Therefore, the respondent with a good background history score of exactly 2 is Respondent 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The Identification field is scored as follows:  
0 = Requires direct prompting  
1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint  
2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete  
3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete  

A poor identification score is 0, meaning the respondent requires direct prompting to identify self, role, and patient.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 19 has Identification = 3  
- Respondent 5 has Identification = 0  
- Respondent 7 has Identification = 3  

Only Respondent 5 has a poor identification score of 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The critical value here is the ""Assessment"" score, which measures the logical assessment quality. According to the rubric, a score of 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning,"" which qualifies as a good clinical assessment score. The possible scores range from 0 (no logical assessment) to 3 (comprehensive logical assessment without questioning). Among the respondents, we look for those with an Assessment score exactly equal to 2.

Respondent 7 has an Assessment score of 2. Respondents 19 and 6 have Assessment scores of 3, which is higher than 2, so they do not meet the exact criterion of 2.

Final answer: 7",True
