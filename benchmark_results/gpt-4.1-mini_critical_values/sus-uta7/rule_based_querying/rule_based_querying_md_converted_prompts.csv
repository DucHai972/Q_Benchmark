<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4"" are found in the ""Frequent_Usage"" field. This field uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" Therefore, respondents with ratings of 4 or 5 indicate a positive inclination toward frequent use of the system. The responses show the following ""Frequent_Usage"" values: Respondent 49 has 5, Respondent 77 has 4, and Respondent 84 has 2. Only respondents 49 and 77 meet the criterion of having frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The critical values and ranges related to this question are from the ""System_Complexity"" field, which is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (the system is not unnecessarily complex) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (the system is unnecessarily complex). We are interested in respondents who rated this as 1 or less, which practically means those who strongly disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex. The respondents' ""System_Complexity"" ratings are: Respondent 55 = 2, Respondent 62 = 3, Respondent 48 = 1. Only Respondent 48 has a rating less than or equal to 1.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings equal to 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""need for technical support ratings equal to 1"" are found in the ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field. This field uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not think they need technical support) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the respondent thinks they need technical support). The respondents' ratings for this field are numeric values between 1 and 5. To answer the question, we look for respondents whose ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" rating is exactly 1.

From the responses:
- Respondent 5 has a rating of 1.
- Respondent 13 has a rating of 1.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. A rating greater than or equal to 4 indicates that the respondent agrees or strongly agrees that there is too much inconsistency in the system. The respondents and their inconsistency ratings are:

- Respondent 19: 5
- Respondent 36: 1
- Respondent 75: 4

Thus, respondents 19 and 75 have inconsistency ratings greater than or equal to 4.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have need to learn before use ratings less than or equal to 2?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""need to learn before use ratings less than or equal to 2"" come from the ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" field, which is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system."" A rating less than or equal to 2 indicates that the respondent disagrees or strongly disagrees with needing to learn a lot before use, implying ease of initial use. The respondents and their respective ratings for this field are: Respondent 3 has a rating of 5, Respondent 88 has a rating of 1, and Respondent 70 has a rating of 1. Therefore, only respondents with ratings 1 or 2 qualify.

</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- System_Complexity is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree (system is not unnecessarily complex) and 5 means Strongly Agree (system is unnecessarily complex).
- Ease_of_Use is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree (system is not easy to use) and 5 means Strongly Agree (system is easy to use).
- The question asks for respondents with System_Complexity ratings ≥ 3 (meaning they find the system somewhat or very complex) and Ease_of_Use ratings ≥ 4 (meaning they find the system easy or very easy to use).
- The respondents are 46, 4, and 23 with their respective ratings.
- We need to check each respondent’s System_Complexity and Ease_of_Use values against these thresholds.

Checking respondents:

- Respondent 46: System_Complexity = 1 (less than 3), Ease_of_Use = 5 (≥4) → Does not meet System_Complexity criterion.
- Respondent 4: System_Complexity = 5 (≥3), Ease_of_Use = 5 (≥4) → Meets both criteria.

Which respondent numbers have cumbersome to use ratings less than 2?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""Which respondent numbers have cumbersome to use ratings less than 2?"" are as follows: The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not find the system awkward to use) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the respondent finds the system very awkward to use). A rating less than 2 means the respondent rated ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" as 1, indicating they strongly disagree that the system is awkward to use. The respondents' ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" ratings are: Respondent 9 = 1, Respondent 86 = 1, Respondent 37 = 3. Therefore, only respondents with a rating of 1 meet the criterion.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings equal to 1?
</task>","The inconsistency rating is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that there is too much inconsistency in the system, indicating the respondent perceives the system as consistent. The critical values here are the ratings of 1, which signify low perceived inconsistency. Among the respondents, we look for those with an inconsistency rating exactly equal to 1.

Respondent 51 has an inconsistency rating of 1.  
Respondent 6 has an inconsistency rating of 1.  
Respondent 72 has an inconsistency rating of 5, so does not qualify.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings between 2 and 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""frequent usage ratings between 2 and 4"" are as follows: The ""Frequent_Usage"" field is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" The range of interest is between 2 and 4 inclusive, meaning respondents who somewhat disagree, are neutral, or somewhat agree with frequent usage. The respondents' ""Frequent_Usage"" values are 5, 4, and 3 for Respondents 60, 77, and 54 respectively. Only values 2, 3, and 4 fall within the specified range. Respondent 60 has a 5, which is outside the range.

Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings equal to 1 and frequent usage ratings equal to 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- System_Complexity is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A rating of 1 means the respondent found the system not complex.  
- Frequent_Usage is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree that they would like to use the system frequently) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A rating of 5 means the respondent strongly agrees they would like to use the system frequently.  
- We need to find respondents with System_Complexity = 1 and Frequent_Usage = 5.  
- From the responses, only Respondent 64 has System_Complexity = 1 and Frequent_Usage = 5.  
- Respondent 6 has System_Complexity = 1 but Frequent_Usage = 4, so does not qualify. Respondent 75 does not meet either condition.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings less than 2?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""need for technical support ratings less than 2"" are as follows: The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not think they need technical support) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the respondent thinks they need technical support). A rating less than 2 means the respondent rated this as 1, indicating they strongly disagree with needing technical support. Among the respondents, the values for ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" are 2, 1, and 2 for Respondents 56, 18, and 22 respectively. Only Respondent 18 has a rating less than 2.

Which respondent numbers have cumbersome to use ratings less than or equal to 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""cumbersome to use ratings less than or equal to 2"" are based on the ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" field, which is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the system is not awkward to use) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the system is very awkward to use). Therefore, ratings less than or equal to 2 indicate respondents who generally disagree or slightly agree that the system is awkward to use, implying they find it relatively easy or not cumbersome.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings less than or equal to 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings less than or equal to 1?"" are as follows: The ""Inconsistency"" field is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system."" A rating less than or equal to 1 means the respondent strongly disagrees or disagrees that the system is inconsistent, indicating they perceive the system as consistent. The respondents' ""Inconsistency"" ratings are: Respondent 66 has a rating of 1, Respondent 85 has a rating of 1, and Respondent 52 has a rating of 4. Therefore, only Respondents 66 and 85 meet the criterion of inconsistency ratings less than or equal to 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
