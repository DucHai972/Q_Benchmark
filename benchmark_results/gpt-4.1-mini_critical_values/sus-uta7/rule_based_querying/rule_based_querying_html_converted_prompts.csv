<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4"" are found in the ""Frequent_Usage"" field. According to the schema, ""Frequent_Usage"" is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" Therefore, ratings of 4 or 5 indicate a positive inclination towards frequent use of the system. The responses section lists three respondents with their respective ""Frequent_Usage"" ratings: Respondent 49 has a rating of 5, Respondent 77 has a rating of 4, and Respondent 84 has a rating of 2. Only Respondents 49 and 77 meet the criterion of having a frequent usage rating greater than or equal to 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""confidence in use ratings equal to 5"" are found in the ""Confidence_in_Use"" field. According to the schema, this field uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I felt very confident using the system."" The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective ratings for this field. To answer the question, we need to identify respondents whose ""Confidence_in_Use"" rating is exactly 5.

Respondent 23 has a confidence in use rating of 4, so does not qualify.  
Respondent 82 has a confidence in use rating of 5.  
Respondent 50 has a confidence in use rating of 5.

Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings less than or equal to 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""system complexity ratings less than or equal to 1"" are as follows: The ""System_Complexity"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (the system is not unnecessarily complex) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (the system is unnecessarily complex). Therefore, ratings less than or equal to 1 correspond to respondents who strongly disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating they find the system simple. The responses show ""System_Complexity"" values for respondents 55, 62, and 48 as 2, 3, and 1 respectively. Only respondent 48 has a ""System_Complexity"" rating less than or equal to 1.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings equal to 1?
</task>","The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field is a Likert scale rating from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not think they need technical support) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the respondent thinks they need technical support). The critical values here are the numeric ratings 1 through 5, with 1 indicating the lowest perceived need for technical support. We are asked to find respondents with a rating equal to 1, meaning those who strongly disagree that they need technical support.

From the responses:
- Respondent 5 has Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
- Respondent 13 has Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
- Respondent 80 has Need_for_Technical_Support = 3

Only Respondents 5 and 13 have a rating of 1 for Need_for_Technical_Support.

Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""system complexity ratings equal to 5"" are as follows:  
The ""System_Complexity"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex"" on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree.""  
A rating of 5 indicates the respondent strongly agrees that the system is unnecessarily complex.  
Among the respondents, we need to identify those whose ""System_Complexity"" rating is exactly 5.  
From the responses, only Respondent 72 has a ""System_Complexity"" rating of 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical value here is the ""Confidence_in_Use"" rating, which is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the respondent felt very confident using the system. We need to identify respondents whose ""Confidence_in_Use"" score is exactly 5. The respondents and their ""Confidence_in_Use"" ratings are: Respondent 36 has 5, Respondent 75 has 2, and Respondent 82 has 5. Therefore, the respondents with a confidence in use rating of 5 are 36 and 82.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings greater than 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""frequent usage ratings greater than 3"" are found in the ""Frequent_Usage"" field. According to the schema, this field uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" Therefore, any respondent with a ""Frequent_Usage"" rating of 4 or 5 meets the criterion of having a frequent usage rating greater than 3. The responses show the following ""Frequent_Usage"" values: Respondent 49 has 5, Respondent 34 has 2, and Respondent 19 has 1. Only Respondent 49 has a rating greater than 3.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4"" are found in the ""Frequent_Usage"" field. According to the schema, ""Frequent_Usage"" is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" Therefore, ratings of 4 and 5 indicate agreement or strong agreement with frequent usage. The respondents' ""Frequent_Usage"" values are: Respondent 81 has 5, Respondent 51 has 4, and Respondent 24 has 1. Only Respondents 81 and 51 meet the criterion of having frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4.

</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" rating is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. A rating greater than or equal to 4 indicates that the respondent agrees or strongly agrees that there was too much inconsistency in the system. The respondents and their ""Inconsistency"" ratings are: Respondent 19 has a rating of 5, Respondent 36 has a rating of 1, and Respondent 75 has a rating of 4.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings less than 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""ease of use ratings less than 3"" are found in the ""Ease_of_Use"" field. According to the schema, ""Ease_of_Use"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use."" Therefore, ratings less than 3 include values 1 and 2, indicating respondents who generally disagree or strongly disagree that the system was easy to use. The responses section lists three respondents with their respective ""Ease_of_Use"" ratings: Respondent 40 has a rating of 1, Respondent 74 has a rating of 5, and Respondent 22 has a rating of 4. Only Respondent 40 has an ""Ease_of_Use"" rating less than 3.

</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- System_Complexity is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex.""  
- Ease_of_Use is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use.""  
- The question asks for respondents with System_Complexity ratings greater than or equal to 4 (meaning they agree or strongly agree that the system is unnecessarily complex) and Ease_of_Use ratings greater than or equal to 4 (meaning they agree or strongly agree that the system was easy to use).  
- The respondents and their ratings are:  
  - Respondent 1: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 5  
  - Respondent 54: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4  
  - Respondent 75: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 2  
- Only Respondent 1 meets both criteria (System_Complexity ≥ 4 and Ease_of_Use ≥ 4).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""confidence in use ratings equal to 5"" are found in the ""Confidence_in_Use"" field. According to the questions schema, ""Confidence_in_Use"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I felt very confident using the system."" The responses section lists individual respondents with their respective ratings for this field. To answer the question, we need to identify respondents whose ""Confidence_in_Use"" rating is exactly 5.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of learning ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""ease of learning ratings equal to 5"" are found in the ""Ease_of_Learning"" field. According to the questions schema, ""Ease_of_Learning"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly."" The responses section lists individual respondent ratings for this field. We need to identify respondents whose ""Ease_of_Learning"" rating is exactly 5.

Respondent 16 has an Ease_of_Learning rating of 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings greater than or equal to 3 and ease of use ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are from the Likert scale questions, which range from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. For ""System_Complexity,"" a higher score (≥3) indicates the respondent found the system more complex. For ""Ease_of_Use,"" a higher score (≥4) indicates the respondent found the system easy to use. We need to identify respondents whose ""System_Complexity"" rating is 3 or more and whose ""Ease_of_Use"" rating is 4 or more. The respondents and their ratings are:

- Respondent 46: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5  
- Respondent 4: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 5  
- Respondent 23: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5  

Only Respondent 4 meets both criteria (System_Complexity ≥ 3 and Ease_of_Use ≥ 4).

<task>
Which respondent numbers have cumbersome to use ratings less than 2?
</task>","The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not find the system awkward to use) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the respondent finds the system very awkward to use). Ratings less than 2 therefore correspond to a rating of 1, indicating respondents who strongly disagree that the system is awkward to use.

Looking at the responses:
- Respondent 9 has a ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" rating of 1.
- Respondent 86 has a ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" rating of 1.
- Respondent 37 has a ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" rating of 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have integration of functions ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""integration of functions ratings equal to 5"" are as follows: The ""Integration_of_Functions"" field is a Likert scale rating from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. We need to identify respondents whose rating for this field is exactly 5. The respondents and their ratings for ""Integration_of_Functions"" are given in the responses section. By checking each respondent's rating for this field, we can determine which respondents have a rating of 5.

Respondent 15 has an Integration_of_Functions rating of 5.  
Respondent 58 has an Integration_of_Functions rating of 5.  
Respondent 46 has an Integration_of_Functions rating of 5.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""need for technical support"" are as follows: The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system."" It uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" A rating of 5 indicates the respondent strongly agrees that they would need technical support. The respondents and their ratings for this field are: Respondent 62 has a rating of 5, Respondent 2 has a rating of 1, and Respondent 70 has a rating of 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings greater than or equal to 3 and ease of use ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are from the Likert scale 1–5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. For ""System_Complexity,"" a rating greater than or equal to 3 indicates the respondent found the system at least somewhat complex or unnecessarily complex. For ""Ease_of_Use,"" a rating greater than or equal to 4 means the respondent thought the system was easy to use or strongly agreed it was easy. We need to identify respondents whose ""System_Complexity"" is 3, 4, or 5 and whose ""Ease_of_Use"" is 4 or 5.

From the responses:

- Respondent 4: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 5  
- Respondent 48: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5 (does not meet complexity criterion)  
- Respondent 21: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 2 (does not meet either criterion)  

Only Respondent 4 meets both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings less than or equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""ease of use ratings less than or equal to 4"" are found in the ""Ease_of_Use"" field. According to the schema, ""Ease_of_Use"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use."" Therefore, ratings less than or equal to 4 include the values 1, 2, 3, and 4. The respondents' ""Ease_of_Use"" scores are given as integers within this range. The task is to identify respondents whose ""Ease_of_Use"" rating is 4 or below.

Respondent 51 has an Ease_of_Use rating of 4.  
Respondent 7 has an Ease_of_Use rating of 5.  
Respondent 85 has an Ease_of_Use rating of 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of learning ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Learning"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The question asks for respondents with ratings greater than or equal to 4, so we are looking for values of 4 or 5 in this field. The respondents and their ""Ease_of_Learning"" ratings are: Respondent 25 has 5, Respondent 86 has 4, and Respondent 69 has 5. All these values meet the criteria of being greater than or equal to 4.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings equal to 2?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""system complexity ratings equal to 2"" are as follows:  
The ""System_Complexity"" field is a Likert scale rating from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex.""  
A rating of 2 indicates a low level of agreement that the system is unnecessarily complex, meaning the respondent somewhat disagrees that the system is complex.  
In the responses, the ""System_Complexity"" values are numeric and range from 1 to 2 in the given data.  
We need to identify respondents whose ""System_Complexity"" rating is exactly 2.

Respondents with system complexity ratings equal to 2 are: 54, 17",False

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings greater than 3?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Use"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use."" Ratings greater than 3 would be 4 or 5, indicating agreement that the system is easy to use. The respondents and their Ease_of_Use ratings are: Respondent 77 has a rating of 4, Respondent 31 has a rating of 5, and Respondent 3 has a rating of 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings less than or equal to 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""confidence in use ratings less than or equal to 3"" are found in the ""Confidence_in_Use"" field. According to the questions schema, ""Confidence_in_Use"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I felt very confident using the system."" Therefore, ratings less than or equal to 3 include the values 1, 2, and 3, indicating low to moderate confidence. The respondents' ""Confidence_in_Use"" scores must be checked against this range to identify those who rated their confidence as 3 or below.

From the responses:
- Respondent 57 has a Confidence_in_Use rating of 2.
- Respondent 34 has a Confidence_in_Use rating of 4.
- Respondent 79 has a Confidence_in_Use rating of 5.

Only Respondent 57 meets the criterion of confidence in use ratings less than or equal to 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings equal to 1?
</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system,"" rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" A rating of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is inconsistent, implying they perceive the system as consistent. The respondents' inconsistency ratings are found in the responses section under each respondent's data. We need to identify which respondents have an inconsistency rating exactly equal to 1.

Respondent 51 has an inconsistency rating of 1.  
Respondent 6 has an inconsistency rating of 1.  
Respondent 72 has an inconsistency rating of 5, so it does not qualify.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings greater than 2?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""need for technical support ratings greater than 2"" come from the ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field, which is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. This field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system."" Therefore, ratings greater than 2 indicate a moderate to strong agreement that technical support is needed. The respondents and their respective ratings for this field are: Respondent 69 has a rating of 1, Respondent 63 has a rating of 5, and Respondent 10 has a rating of 2. Only ratings strictly greater than 2 qualify.

</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""frequent usage ratings between 2 and 4"" are found in the ""Frequent_Usage"" field. According to the schema, ""Frequent_Usage"" is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" The relevant range for this question is therefore the integer values 2, 3, and 4 inclusive. The respondents' ""Frequent_Usage"" ratings must be checked against these values to identify which respondents fall within this range.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of learning ratings less than 3?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Learning"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. Ratings less than 3 therefore include values 1 and 2. From the responses, the Ease_of_Learning ratings are: Respondent 25 has 5, Respondent 72 has 1, and Respondent 6 has 5. Only Respondent 72 has an Ease_of_Learning rating less than 3.

Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings equal to 1 and frequent usage ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant to this question are as follows:  
- System_Complexity is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity.  
- Frequent_Usage is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the respondent would like to use the system frequently.  
- We need to identify respondents whose System_Complexity rating is exactly 1 and Frequent_Usage rating is exactly 5.  
- The respondents and their ratings are clearly listed under the Responses section.  
- Only respondents meeting both criteria simultaneously should be included in the answer.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings less than 2?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to this question are as follows: The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the need for technical support. A rating less than 2 means the respondent strongly disagrees or disagrees that they need technical support, so only a rating of 1 qualifies. The respondents and their ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" ratings are: Respondent 56 has a rating of 2, Respondent 18 has a rating of 1, and Respondent 22 has a rating of 2. Therefore, only Respondent 18 has a rating less than 2.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have cumbersome to use ratings less than or equal to 2?
</task>","The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I found the system very awkward to use."" A rating less than or equal to 2 indicates that the respondent generally disagrees or strongly disagrees that the system is awkward to use, implying ease of use. The respondents and their ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" ratings are: Respondent 84 has a rating of 3, Respondent 41 has a rating of 5, and Respondent 59 has a rating of 1.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings greater than or equal to 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings greater than or equal to 3?"" are as follows: The ""Inconsistency"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system."" We are interested in respondents whose ratings are 3, 4, or 5, indicating moderate to strong agreement that the system is inconsistent. The respondents and their ""Inconsistency"" ratings are: Respondent 39 has a rating of 3, Respondent 77 has a rating of 1, and Respondent 65 has a rating of 1. Only Respondent 39 meets the criterion of having an inconsistency rating greater than or equal to 3.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings less than or equal to 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings less than or equal to 1?"" are as follows: The ""Inconsistency"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system."" Therefore, a rating of 1 or less (which practically means 1, since the scale starts at 1) indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is inconsistent. The respondents and their ""Inconsistency"" ratings are: Respondent 66 has a rating of 1, Respondent 85 has a rating of 1, and Respondent 52 has a rating of 4. Only respondents 66 and 85 meet the criterion of inconsistency ratings less than or equal to 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to this question are as follows: The ""Ease_of_Use"" field is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use."" The respondents' ratings for ""Ease_of_Use"" are given as numeric values within this range. We need to identify respondents whose ""Ease_of_Use"" rating is exactly 4. The respondents listed are 69, 51, and 81, with their respective ""Ease_of_Use"" ratings being 5, 4, and 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""ease of use ratings equal to 5"" are found in the ""Ease_of_Use"" field. According to the questions schema, ""Ease_of_Use"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use."" Therefore, respondents with a rating of 5 strongly agree that the system was easy to use. The relevant data points are the ""Ease_of_Use"" values for each respondent in the responses section.

From the responses:
- Respondent 36 has Ease_of_Use = 1
- Respondent 23 has Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 70 has Ease_of_Use = 5

Final answer: 23, 70",True
