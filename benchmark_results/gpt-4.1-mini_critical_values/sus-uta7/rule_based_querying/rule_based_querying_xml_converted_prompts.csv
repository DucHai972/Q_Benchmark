<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The ""Frequent_Usage"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" The critical values for this question are the integers 1 through 5, with higher values indicating stronger agreement to the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" We are interested in respondents with ratings greater than or equal to 4, meaning those who agree or strongly agree with frequent usage. The respondents' ratings are:  
- Respondent 49: 5  
- Respondent 77: 4  
- Respondent 84: 2  

Only respondents 49 and 77 have ratings ≥ 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The ""Confidence_in_Use"" question is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" The critical values to identify respondents with a rating of 5 are the numeric values in the ""Confidence_in_Use"" answers within the responses. The respondents with a rating of 5 for ""Confidence_in_Use"" are those whose answer to this question is exactly 5.

Respondents and their ""Confidence_in_Use"" ratings:

Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings less than or equal to 1?
</task>","The ""System_Complexity"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex."" A rating less than or equal to 1 indicates respondents strongly disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex, implying they find it simple or not complex. The critical values for this question are integers from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest complexity perception. The respondents' ratings for ""System_Complexity"" are:  
- Respondent 55: 2  
- Respondent 62: 3  
- Respondent 48: 1  

Only respondent 48 has a ""System_Complexity"" rating less than or equal to 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of learning ratings equal to 4?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Learning"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" The critical value to identify is the rating of 4, which indicates a high level of agreement that most people would learn to use the system very quickly. We need to find respondents whose ""Ease_of_Learning"" answer is exactly 4.

From the responses:
- Respondent 84 has Ease_of_Learning = 4
- Respondent 19 has Ease_of_Learning = 4
- Respondent 80 has Ease_of_Learning = 4

A rating of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that they would need technical support to use the system, implying they feel confident using it independently. The respondents' answers to this question are numeric values within this range. We need to identify respondents whose rating for this question is exactly 1.

Respondents with ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" equal to 1 are: 5, 13",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings equal to 5?"" are as follows: The ""Ease_of_Use"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system was easy to use. Respondents' answers to this question are numeric values within this range. The respondent IDs are unique identifiers for each individual in the dataset. To answer the question, we must identify respondents whose ""Ease_of_Use"" answer is exactly 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings greater than 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""frequent usage ratings greater than 3"" are found in the question with id ""Frequent_Usage."" This question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" Therefore, any respondent with a rating of 4 or 5 indicates a higher frequency of intended system use. The respondents' ratings for this question are: 49 has 5, 34 has 2, and 19 has 1. Only respondent 49 has a frequent usage rating greater than 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The ""Frequent_Usage"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" The critical values for this question are integers within this range, and we are interested in respondents with ratings greater than or equal to 4, meaning those who ""Agree"" or ""Strongly Agree"" that they would like to use the system frequently. The respondents' ratings are as follows: respondent 81 has a rating of 5, respondent 51 has a rating of 4, and respondent 24 has a rating of 1. Only respondents 81 and 51 meet the criterion of having a frequent usage rating of 4 or higher.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system."" A rating greater than or equal to 4 indicates that the respondent perceives the system as having a high level of inconsistency. The possible values for this rating are integers 1 through 5, with 4 and 5 representing strong agreement with the statement of inconsistency.

From the responses:
- Respondent 19 has an inconsistency rating of 5.
- Respondent 36 has an inconsistency rating of 1.
- Respondent 75 has an inconsistency rating of 4.

Therefore, respondents with inconsistency ratings greater than or equal to 4 are 19 and 75.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings less than 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""ease of use ratings less than 3"" are found in the question with id ""Ease_of_Use"". This question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use."" Therefore, ratings less than 3 correspond to values 1 or 2, indicating disagreement or low ease of use. The respondents' answers to this question are numeric values within this range. We need to identify respondents whose ""Ease_of_Use"" answer is either 1 or 2.

Respondents and their Ease_of_Use ratings:
- Respondent 40: 1
- Respondent 74: 5
- Respondent 22: 4

Only respondent 40 has an ease of use rating less than 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings greater than or equal to 4 and ease of use ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- ""System_Complexity"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex.""  
- ""Ease_of_Use"" is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use.""  
- The task requires identifying respondents with ""System_Complexity"" ratings greater than or equal to 4 (i.e., 4 or 5) and ""Ease_of_Use"" ratings greater than or equal to 4 (i.e., 4 or 5).  
- The respondents and their ratings are:  
  - Respondent 1: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 5  
  - Respondent 54: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4  
  - Respondent 75: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 2  
- Only respondent 1 meets both criteria.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have ease of learning ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Learning"" question asks respondents to rate how quickly most people would learn to use the system on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The critical value here is the rating of 5, indicating strong agreement that most people would learn to use the system very quickly. The respondents' answers to this question are numeric values between 1 and 5. We need to identify respondents whose ""Ease_of_Learning"" rating is exactly 5.

Respondent 16 has an Ease_of_Learning rating of 4.  
Respondent 26 has an Ease_of_Learning rating of 5.  
Respondent 87 has an Ease_of_Learning rating of 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need to learn before use ratings less than or equal to 2?
</task>","The ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" question measures the extent to which respondents felt they needed to learn a lot before using the system, rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., they did not need to learn much) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., they needed to learn a lot). Therefore, ratings less than or equal to 2 indicate respondents who felt they needed little to no learning before use. The respondents and their ratings for this question are:  
- Respondent 3: 5  
- Respondent 88: 1  
- Respondent 70: 1  

Only respondents 88 and 70 have ratings less than or equal to 2.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings greater than or equal to 3 and ease of use ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are from the Likert scale questions, which range from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. Specifically, ""System_Complexity"" measures how complex the system is perceived, with higher values indicating more complexity. ""Ease_of_Use"" measures how easy the system is perceived to use, with higher values indicating greater ease. The task requires identifying respondents with ""System_Complexity"" ratings ≥ 3 (indicating moderate to high perceived complexity) and ""Ease_of_Use"" ratings ≥ 4 (indicating high ease of use). The respondents' answers are numeric values within this 1–5 range.

Respondent 46: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5  
Respondent 4: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 5  
Respondent 23: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5  

Only respondent 4 meets both criteria: System_Complexity ≥ 3 and Ease_of_Use ≥ 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have cumbersome to use ratings less than 2?
</task>","The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I found the system very awkward to use."" A rating less than 2 means the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is awkward to use, indicating they found it not cumbersome. The possible values are integers 1 through 5. We need to identify respondents with a ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" rating of 1.

Respondent 9 has a rating of 1 for ""Cumbersome_to_Use.""  
Respondent 86 has a rating of 1 for ""Cumbersome_to_Use.""  
Respondent 37 has a rating of 3 for ""Cumbersome_to_Use,"" which is not less than 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""confidence in use ratings equal to 5"" are found in the question with id ""Confidence_in_Use"". According to the schema, this is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"". The responses section contains individual respondent data with their ratings for ""Confidence_in_Use"". To answer the question, we need to identify respondents whose ""Confidence_in_Use"" answer is exactly 5.

From the responses:
- Respondent 59 has a ""Confidence_in_Use"" rating of 5.
- Respondent 13 has a ""Confidence_in_Use"" rating of 5.
- Respondent 26 has a ""Confidence_in_Use"" rating of 4.

Which respondent numbers have system complexity ratings greater than or equal to 3 and ease of use ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The ""System_Complexity"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex. A rating greater than or equal to 3 indicates the respondent found the system at least moderately complex. The ""Ease_of_Use"" question also uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system was easy to use. A rating greater than or equal to 4 indicates the respondent found the system easy to use. The respondents' data shows their ratings for these two questions, allowing us to identify those who rated system complexity ≥ 3 and ease of use ≥ 4.

Respondent 4 has a system complexity rating of 5 and ease of use rating of 5.  
Respondent 48 has a system complexity rating of 1 and ease of use rating of 5.  
Respondent 21 has a system complexity rating of 1 and ease of use rating of 2.

Only respondent 4 meets both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings equal to 5 and confidence in use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Use"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system was easy to use. Similarly, the ""Confidence_in_Use"" question also uses the same Likert scale, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the respondent felt very confident using the system. The respondents' answers are numeric values from 1 to 5, representing their level of agreement.

From the responses:
- Respondent 8 has Ease_of_Use = 5 and Confidence_in_Use = 5.
- Respondent 10 has Ease_of_Use = 2 and Confidence_in_Use = 4.
- Respondent 82 has Ease_of_Use = 5 and Confidence_in_Use = 5.

Therefore, respondents with both Ease_of_Use and Confidence_in_Use ratings equal to 5 are 8 and 82.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings less than or equal to 4?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Use"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system was easy to use. Ratings less than or equal to 4 include values 1, 2, 3, and 4, indicating varying degrees of disagreement or moderate agreement with ease of use. Respondents with ratings of 4 or below found the system less than fully easy to use or only somewhat easy to use. The relevant values to check in the responses are the numeric scores under the ""Ease_of_Use"" question for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of learning ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Learning"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. Ratings greater than or equal to 4 indicate respondents who agree or strongly agree that most people would learn to use the system very quickly. The respondents' ""Ease_of_Learning"" ratings are:  
- Respondent 25: 5  
- Respondent 86: 4  
- Respondent 69: 5  

All three respondents have ratings greater than or equal to 4.

</task>","The ""System_Complexity"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex."" A rating of 2 indicates slight disagreement with the system being unnecessarily complex, suggesting the respondent found the system only mildly complex. The respondents' answers to this question are numeric values within this range. We need to identify respondents who rated ""System_Complexity"" exactly as 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The ""Frequent_Usage"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" The critical values here are the numeric ratings from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the highest level of agreement. We need to identify respondents whose rating for ""Frequent_Usage"" is exactly 5. The respondents and their ""Frequent_Usage"" ratings are:  
- Respondent 24: 1  
- Respondent 89: 5  
- Respondent 67: 5

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings greater than 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings greater than 3?"" are as follows: The ""Ease_of_Use"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system was easy to use. Therefore, ratings greater than 3 correspond to values 4 and 5, indicating respondents who found the system easy to use. The respondents' ""Ease_of_Use"" answers are numeric values within this range. The relevant respondents and their ratings must be checked to identify those with ratings of 4 or 5.

Respondents with ""Ease_of_Use"" ratings greater than 3 are: 31 (rating 5) and 77 (rating 4).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings less than or equal to 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""confidence in use ratings less than or equal to 3"" are found in the ""Confidence_in_Use"" question. This question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I felt very confident using the system."" We need to identify respondents whose ratings are 3 or below, indicating neutral to low confidence. The respondents and their ""Confidence_in_Use"" ratings are:  
- Respondent 57: 2  
- Respondent 34: 4  
- Respondent 79: 5  
Only respondents with ratings 3 or less qualify.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings equal to 1?
</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system."" A rating of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is inconsistent, implying they perceive the system as consistent. The respondents' inconsistency ratings are found in the responses section under the ""Inconsistency"" question. The critical values to identify are those with a rating exactly equal to 1.

Respondents with inconsistency ratings equal to 1 are: 51, 6",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings greater than 2?
</task>","The ""Need for Technical Support"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the need for technical support. A rating greater than 2 indicates that the respondent somewhat agrees or strongly agrees that they would need technical support to use the system. The respondents' ratings for this question are:  
- Respondent 69: 1 (Strongly Disagree)  
- Respondent 63: 5 (Strongly Agree)  
- Respondent 10: 2 (Disagree)  

Only respondent 63 has a rating greater than 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have ease of learning ratings less than 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""ease of learning"" are found in the question with id ""Ease_of_Learning."" This question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly."" The responses section contains individual respondent answers with numeric values for this question. To find respondents with ease of learning ratings less than 3, we look for those with values 1 or 2 in the ""Ease_of_Learning"" field.

Respondent 25 has an ease of learning rating of 5.  
Respondent 72 has an ease of learning rating of 1.  
Respondent 6 has an ease of learning rating of 5.

- ""System_Complexity"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the system is not unnecessarily complex) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the system is unnecessarily complex).  
- ""Frequent_Usage"" is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (would not like to use frequently) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (would like to use frequently).  
- The question asks for respondents who rated ""System_Complexity"" as 1 and ""Frequent_Usage"" as 5.  
- From the responses, these values must be checked per respondent to identify matching IDs.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have confidence in use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The ""Confidence_in_Use"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" The critical values here are the ratings given by respondents, specifically looking for those who rated their confidence in using the system as 5, indicating the highest level of confidence. The respondents' answers are numerical values corresponding to this scale. The relevant data points are found in the ""Confidence_in_Use"" answers within each respondent's data.

Respondents with ""Confidence_in_Use"" ratings equal to 5 are: 53, 18",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings greater than or equal to 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""ease of use ratings greater than or equal to 4"" are found in the question with id ""Ease_of_Use"". This question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use."" Therefore, ratings of 4 or 5 indicate that the respondent agrees or strongly agrees that the system was easy to use. The respondents' answers to this question are numeric values between 1 and 5, and we need to identify those with values 4 or 5.

Respondent 33 has an Ease_of_Use rating of 3, which is below 4.  
Respondent 30 has an Ease_of_Use rating of 5, which meets the criterion.  
Respondent 59 has an Ease_of_Use rating of 5, which meets the criterion.

A rating less than 2 means the respondent strongly disagrees or disagrees that they need technical support to use the system, indicating low or no need for technical support. The respondents' ratings for this question are:  
- Respondent 56: 2

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have cumbersome to use ratings less than or equal to 2?
</task>","The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I found the system very awkward to use."" A rating less than or equal to 2 indicates that the respondent generally disagrees or strongly disagrees that the system is awkward to use, implying they found it relatively easy or not very awkward.

Among the respondents:
- Respondent 84 has a rating of 3 (greater than 2).
- Respondent 41 has a rating of 5 (greater than 2).
- Respondent 59 has a rating of 1 (less than or equal to 2).

Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings greater than 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings greater than 3?"" are found in the question with id ""Inconsistency."" According to the schema, the ""Inconsistency"" rating is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system."" Therefore, a rating greater than 3 means the respondent agrees or strongly agrees that the system has too much inconsistency. The relevant data points are the ""Inconsistency"" answers for each respondent in the responses section.

From the responses:
- Respondent 30 has an inconsistency rating of 1.
- Respondent 89 has an inconsistency rating of 1.
- Respondent 35 has an inconsistency rating of 4.

Only respondent 35 has an inconsistency rating greater than 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings greater than or equal to 3?
</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system."" Ratings greater than or equal to 3 indicate a neutral to strong agreement that the system is inconsistent. The respondents' inconsistency ratings are:  
- Respondent 39: 3  
- Respondent 77: 1  
- Respondent 65: 1  

Only respondent 39 has an inconsistency rating greater than or equal to 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have frequent usage ratings less than 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""frequent usage ratings less than 3"" are found in the question with id ""Frequent_Usage."" This question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" Therefore, any respondent with a rating of 1 or 2 falls under the category of having frequent usage ratings less than 3. The respondents' answers are numeric values within this range, and we must identify those with values 1 or 2.

Respondents and their ""Frequent_Usage"" ratings:
- Respondent 5: 4
- Respondent 60: 5
- Respondent 28: 1

Only respondent 28 has a frequent usage rating less than 3.

Which respondent numbers have inconsistency ratings less than or equal to 1?
</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" question is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that there is too much inconsistency in the system. A rating less than or equal to 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that there is too much inconsistency, implying they perceive the system as consistent.

Looking at the responses:
- Respondent 66 has an Inconsistency rating of 1.
- Respondent 85 has an Inconsistency rating of 1.
- Respondent 52 has an Inconsistency rating of 4.

Only respondents 66 and 85 have inconsistency ratings less than or equal to 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have need for technical support ratings equal to 2?
</task>","The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the need for technical support. A rating of 2 indicates a low but not the lowest perceived need for technical support. The respondents' ratings for this question are found in the responses section under the ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field. We need to identify respondents whose rating for this question is exactly 2.

Respondent 50 has a rating of 2 for ""Need_for_Technical_Support"".  
Respondent 19 has a rating of 1.  
Respondent 73 has a rating of 1.

Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings equal to 4?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Use"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use."" The critical values for this question are integers within this range, with higher values indicating greater ease of use. Respondents with a rating of 4 agree that the system was easy to use, but not as strongly as those who rated it 5. The dataset contains three respondents with their respective ""Ease_of_Use"" ratings: 69 (5), 51 (4), and 81 (5). Only respondent 51 has an ease of use rating equal to 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have ease of use ratings equal to 5?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Use"" question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system was easy to use. The critical values to identify are respondents who rated this question as 5, indicating they strongly agree the system was easy to use. The respondents' IDs and their corresponding ""Ease_of_Use"" ratings are given in the responses section. By examining these values, we can determine which respondents rated ease of use as 5.
