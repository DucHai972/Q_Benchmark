<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a group of A?
</task>","The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. The responses list three respondents with their group codes: Respondent 8 is A, Respondent 6 is D, and Respondent 82 is D. Therefore, only Respondent 8 belongs to group A, which corresponds to ""Senior.""

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a confidence in use score of 1?
</task>","The ""Confidence_in_Use"" field measures how confident the respondent felt using the system, rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The critical values for this field range from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates very low confidence and 5 indicates very high confidence. Among the respondents, only one has a ""Confidence_in_Use"" score of 1. This score is found in the responses section under Respondent 38, named Clinician 38.

</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system,"" rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A score of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is inconsistent, implying they perceive the system as consistent. In the responses, the ""Inconsistency"" scores are 1 for Clinician 74, Clinician 60, and 1 for others as well. The critical values to identify are those respondents with an ""Inconsistency"" score exactly equal to 1.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a need for technical support score of 1?
</task>","The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system,"" rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A score of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees with needing technical support, implying they feel confident using the system independently. In the responses, three respondents have this score: Clinician 55, Clinician 67, and no others. The other respondents have higher scores indicating more perceived need for technical support.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a ease of learning score of 5?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Learning"" field is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly."" The critical values to identify are those respondents who scored a 5, indicating strong agreement that the system is easy to learn. Among the respondents, Clinician 87 and Clinician 4 have scores of 5 and 4 respectively, but only Clinician 87 has a score of 5. Clinician 84 has a score of 4, which does not meet the criterion.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","The ""System_Complexity"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex,"" rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the system is not complex) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the system is very complex). A score of 1 indicates the respondent found the system not complex at all. In the responses, three respondents are listed: Clinician 47, Clinician 19, and Clinician 32. Among them, Clinician 47 has a system complexity score of 1, while Clinician 19 has 2, and Clinician 32 has 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a need to learn before use score of 1?
</task>","The ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" score ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (the respondent did not need to learn a lot before using the system) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (the respondent needed to learn a lot before use). This score indicates how much prior learning the respondent felt was necessary before they could effectively use the system. In the responses, this score is given as a single integer per respondent.

From the data:
- Clinician 56 has a Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score of 1.
- Clinician 6 has a Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score of 1.
- Clinician 62 has a Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score of 4.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Who has a ease of learning score of 4?
</task>","The ""Ease_of_Learning"" field is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly."" The responses section shows three respondents with their respective scores for ""Ease_of_Learning"": Clinician 15 has a score of 4, Clinician 30 has a score of 5, and Clinician 85 has a score of 5. Therefore, only Clinician 15 has an ease of learning score of 4.

<task>
Who has a cumbersome to use score of 2?
</task>","The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" field measures how awkward the respondent found the system to use, rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A score of 2 indicates slight disagreement that the system was very awkward to use, meaning the respondent found it only a little awkward. In the responses, this score is explicitly listed for each respondent under the ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" field. The critical values to identify are those respondents with a ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" score exactly equal to 2. From the data, Clinician 23 and Clinician 14 have this score.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a group of A?
</task>","The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. The responses list three respondents with their group codes: Respondent 45 is A, Respondent 37 is D, and Respondent 49 is D. Therefore, only Respondent 45 belongs to group A, which corresponds to ""Senior.""

<task>
Who has a need to learn before use score of 2?
</task>","The ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" field measures how much a respondent felt they needed to learn before they could get going with the system, rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A score of 2 indicates slight disagreement, meaning the respondent felt they did not need to learn much before use. Among the respondents, the values for this field are 2 for Clinician 41, 1 for Clinician 85, and 1 for Clinician 38. Therefore, only Clinician 41 has a ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" score of 2.

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question ""Who has a system complexity score of 1?"" are as follows: The ""System_Complexity"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex"" on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the system is not complex) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the system is very complex). The responses section lists three respondents with their respective scores for ""System_Complexity."" Identifying those with a score of 1 means selecting respondents who strongly disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex. The relevant respondents and their scores are clearly indicated in the data.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a need for technical support score of 2?
</task>","The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field measures the respondent's agreement with needing technical support to use the system, rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A score of 2 indicates slight disagreement, meaning the respondent generally does not feel they need much technical support. The responses include three respondents: Clinician 22 with a score of 2, Clinician 12 with a score of 1, and Clinician 61 with a score of 1. Only Clinician 22 has a score of 2 for this field.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a confidence in use score of 5?
</task>","The ""Confidence_in_Use"" field is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" with the statement ""I felt very confident using the system."" The responses section lists three respondents with their respective scores. Clinician 87 has a confidence in use score of 5, Clinician 72 has a score of 1, and Clinician 68 has a score of 4. Therefore, only Clinician 87 has a confidence in use score of 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 5?
</task>","The critical values related to the question ""Who has a frequent usage score of 5?"" are found in the ""Frequent_Usage"" field, which is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" The responses section lists three respondents with their respective scores for Frequent_Usage. Only those respondents with a score of 5 in this field are relevant to the answer.

Clinician 58 has a Frequent_Usage score of 5.  
Clinician 90 has a Frequent_Usage score of 5.  
Clinician 6 has a Frequent_Usage score of 4, which does not meet the criterion.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a system complexity score of 1?
</task>","The ""System_Complexity"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex"" on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the system is not complex) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the system is very complex). A score of 1 indicates the respondent found the system not complex at all. In the responses, three respondents have provided data: Clinician 14, Clinician 53, and Clinician 69. All three have a ""System_Complexity"" score of 1, indicating they strongly disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex.

<task>
Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system,"" rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A score of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is inconsistent, implying they perceive the system as consistent. In the responses, the ""Inconsistency"" scores are as follows: Clinician 78 has 1, Clinician 22 has 2, and Clinician 14 has 1. Therefore, the respondents with an inconsistency score of 1 are Clinician 78 and Clinician 14.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a need for technical support score of 2?
</task>","The ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system,"" rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A score of 2 indicates slight disagreement, meaning the respondent generally does not feel a strong need for technical support. In the responses, the values for this field range from 1 to 2, with no higher scores present. The respondents with a score of 2 for this field are Clinician 37 and Clinician 50.

Who has a integration of functions score of 5?
</task>","The ""Integration_of_Functions"" field measures how well the respondent found the various functions in the system to be integrated, rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The critical value here is a score of 5, indicating the respondent strongly agrees that the functions are well integrated. Among the respondents, only those with a score of 5 in this field meet the criteria. The respondents are Clinician 23, Clinician 13, and Clinician 16, with scores of 5, 4, and 4 respectively, so only Clinician 23 has a score of 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Who has a frequent usage score of 2?
</task>","The critical value to identify here is the ""Frequent_Usage"" score, which is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."" We need to find respondents whose ""Frequent_Usage"" score is exactly 2. The responses show three respondents: Clinician 18 with a score of 2, Clinician 44 with a score of 3, and Clinician 71 with a score of 4. Only Clinician 18 has a ""Frequent_Usage"" score of 2.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a confidence in use score of 1?
</task>","The ""Confidence_in_Use"" field measures how confident the respondent felt using the system, rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The critical values here are the individual scores given by each respondent for this field. Among the respondents, the scores for ""Confidence_in_Use"" are 1, 4, and 3. Specifically, Clinician 3 has a score of 1, Clinician 41 has a score of 4, and Clinician 40 has a score of 3. Therefore, the only respondent with a confidence in use score of 1 is Clinician 3.

Who has a cumbersome to use score of 1?
</task>","The ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" field is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is awkward to use, indicating ease of use, and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system is awkward to use, indicating difficulty. The respondents' scores for this field range from 1 to 2 in the given data. Identifying those with a score of 1 means finding respondents who strongly disagree that the system is awkward to use, implying they find it easy to use.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

Who has a group of C?
</task>","The ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. The responses list three respondents with their group codes: Respondent 25 has group C, Respondent 86 has group A, and Respondent 7 has group B. The critical value here is the group code ""C,"" which corresponds to ""Middle.""

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Who has a inconsistency score of 1?
</task>","The ""Inconsistency"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system,"" rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A score of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is inconsistent, implying they perceive the system as consistent. Among the respondents, the inconsistency scores are: Clinician 81 = 1, Clinician 84 = 1, and Clinician 9 = 2. Therefore, the respondents with an inconsistency score of 1 are Clinician 81 and Clinician 84.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
