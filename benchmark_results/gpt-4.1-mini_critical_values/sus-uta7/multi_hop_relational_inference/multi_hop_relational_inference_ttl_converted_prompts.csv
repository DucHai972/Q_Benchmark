<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 4 and Integration_of_Functions of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently.""  
- Integration_of_Functions is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.""  
- Respondent data includes these values as string numbers from ""1"" to ""5"".

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity.  
- Need_for_Technical_Support is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the respondent needs technical support, indicating low need for support.  
- Respondents with System_Complexity of 1 perceive the system as not complex.  
- Respondents with Need_for_Technical_Support of 1 feel confident to use the system without technical help.  
- The question asks for respondents who have both these values equal to 1.

From the responses:  
- Respondent24 has System_Complexity ""1"" and Need_for_Technical_Support ""1"".  
- Respondent61 has System_Complexity ""1"" and Need_for_Technical_Support ""1"".  
- Respondent57 does not meet the criteria (System_Complexity ""4"", Need_for_Technical_Support ""4"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Integration_of_Functions of 5 and Ease_of_Learning of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant to the question are as follows:  
- Integration_of_Functions is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree that the functions are well integrated.  
- Ease_of_Learning is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree that most people would learn to use the system very quickly.  
- We need to identify respondents who scored exactly 5 on both Integration_of_Functions and Ease_of_Learning.

Which respondent numbers have Inconsistency of 1 and Cumbersome_to_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The Inconsistency question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that there is too much inconsistency in the system. Similarly, Cumbersome_to_Use is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is awkward to use, and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" The critical values for this task are Inconsistency = 1 and Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, indicating respondents who strongly disagree that the system is inconsistent and awkward to use. The respondents' data shows these values explicitly as numeric strings.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Group C and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are:  
- Group is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"".  
- We need to identify respondents whose Group is ""Middle"" (corresponding to C) and whose Need_to_Learn_Before_Use value is exactly 1.  
- The respondents provided are Respondent36 (Group B), Respondent57 (Group C), and Respondent68 (Group C).  
- Among these, only those with Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1 and Group = C qualify.

Checking the data:  
- Respondent57: Group C, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 5 (does not qualify)  
- Respondent68: Group C, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1 (qualifies)

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 2 and Integration_of_Functions of 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- Frequent_Usage is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently.""  
- Integration_of_Functions is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, indicating agreement with ""I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.""  
- Respondent data includes these numeric values as strings, e.g., ""2"" or ""3"".  
- The question asks for respondents with Frequent_Usage = 2 and Integration_of_Functions = 3 exactly.  
- Only three respondents are listed, so the search is limited to Respondent21, Respondent53, and Respondent31.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent21: Frequent_Usage = ""1"", Integration_of_Functions = ""2"" → No  
- Respondent53: Frequent_Usage = ""5"", Integration_of_Functions = ""5"" → No

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- Group is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- Confidence_in_Use is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to feeling very confident using the system.
- We need to find respondents whose Group is ""Junior"" (corresponding to B) and whose Confidence_in_Use score is 5.
- From the responses, only Respondent81 has Group ""B"" and Confidence_in_Use ""5"".

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Ease_of_Use of 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- Ease_of_Use is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree, indicating how easy the respondent found the system to use.
- Cumbersome_to_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree, indicating how awkward the respondent found the system to use.
- The question asks for respondents who rated Ease_of_Use as 5 (strongly agree that the system was easy to use) and Cumbersome_to_Use as 1 (strongly disagree that the system was awkward to use).
- The responses section includes three respondents: Respondent55, Respondent87, and Respondent88.
- Checking their values for Ease_of_Use and Cumbersome_to_Use will identify which meet the criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Ease_of_Use of 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- Ease_of_Use is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system was easy to use, and 5 means ""Strongly Agree.""  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the respondent needed to learn a lot before using the system, and 5 means ""Strongly Agree.""  
- We are looking specifically for respondents who rated Ease_of_Use as 1 (strongly disagree that the system was easy to use) and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 5 (strongly agree that they needed to learn a lot before use).  
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Confidence_in_Use of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are:  
- System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity perception.  
- Confidence_in_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the respondent felt very confident using the system.  
- We are looking for respondents who rated System_Complexity as 1 (low complexity) and Confidence_in_Use as 5 (high confidence).  
- The respondents in the data are Respondent56, Respondent10, and Respondent80 with their respective scores.  
- Only those matching both criteria exactly should be listed.

- Integration_of_Functions is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.
- Cumbersome_to_Use is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 = Strongly Disagree (meaning not cumbersome) and 5 = Strongly Agree (very cumbersome).
- We are looking for respondents who strongly agree that the functions are well integrated (score 5) and strongly disagree that the system is awkward to use (score 1).
- The relevant respondents and their scores for these two fields are:
  - Respondent39: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Cumbersome_to_Use = 5 (does not meet criteria)
  - Respondent90: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 (meets criteria)
  - Respondent86: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 (meets criteria)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 3 and Integration_of_Functions of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are from the questions schema:  
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree, indicating how much the respondent would like to use the system frequently.  
- Integration_of_Functions is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, measuring how well the respondent found the various functions in the system were integrated.  
- Respondent data shows these values as string numbers ""1"" to ""5"".  
- We need to identify respondents with Frequent_Usage = ""3"" and Integration_of_Functions = ""5"".  
- The respondents' IDs are Respondent68, Respondent56, and Respondent88.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent68: Frequent_Usage ""3"", Integration_of_Functions ""5""

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Ease_of_Learning of 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The Ease_of_Learning question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that most people would learn to use the system very quickly.  
The Cumbersome_to_Use question also uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system is very awkward to use.  
We are looking for respondents who strongly agree that most people would learn quickly (Ease_of_Learning = 5) and strongly disagree that the system is awkward (Cumbersome_to_Use = 1).  
The relevant respondents are those with Ease_of_Learning = 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 in their responses.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- Frequent_Usage is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently.""  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.""  
- We are looking specifically for respondents who answered ""1"" (Strongly Disagree) to both these questions.  
- The responses section lists three respondents with their respective values for these fields.  
- Only respondents with both Frequent_Usage = 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1 should be selected.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent39: Frequent_Usage = 3, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2 → No

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Group C and Frequent_Usage of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant to the question are as follows:  
- Group is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.  
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree.  
- We need to identify respondents whose Group is ""Middle"" (corresponding to ""C"") and whose Frequent_Usage score is ""1"".  
- The responses provide Group as a single letter code and Frequent_Usage as a numeric string.  
- Only respondents matching both criteria should be listed by their respondent numbers.

From the responses:  
- Respondent31: Group ""D"" (Intern), Frequent_Usage ""2"" → no

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity.
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the respondent needed to learn a lot before using the system, indicating minimal learning required.
- The question asks for respondents with System_Complexity = 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.
- From the responses, these values are explicitly given as string numbers.
- Only respondents matching both criteria exactly should be selected.

Checking the responses:

- Respondent84: System_Complexity = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 4 → No
- Respondent24: System_Complexity = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1 → Yes

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Ease_of_Learning of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are:  
- System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity.  
- Ease_of_Learning is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that most people would learn to use the system very quickly, indicating high ease of learning.  
- Respondent data shows these values as string numbers, so ""1"" corresponds to the lowest complexity and ""5"" to the highest ease of learning.  
- The question asks for respondents with System_Complexity = 1 and Ease_of_Learning = 5.  
- Only respondents matching both criteria should be listed by their respondent numbers.

From the responses:  
- Respondent16: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 4 (No)

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently.""  
- Inconsistency is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.""  
- The question asks for respondents with Frequent_Usage exactly 3 and Inconsistency exactly 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Need_for_Technical_Support of 1 and Integration_of_Functions of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are from the questions schema:  
- Need_for_Technical_Support is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not think they need technical support).  
- Integration_of_Functions is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the respondent found the functions well integrated).  
In the responses, these values are given as string numbers ""1"" through ""5"".  
We need to identify respondents with Need_for_Technical_Support = ""1"" and Integration_of_Functions = ""5"".  
From the data, these fields are directly comparable as strings representing integers.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Inconsistency of 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The Inconsistency question uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that there is too much inconsistency in the system. A value of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is inconsistent.  
The Need_to_Learn_Before_Use question also uses a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the respondent needed to learn a lot before using the system. A value of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that they needed to learn a lot before use.  
Both values of 1 represent the most negative agreement with the statements, indicating low perceived inconsistency and low perceived need to learn before use.  
The respondents' data shows these values explicitly as string numbers ""1"".  
The question asks for respondent numbers (IDs) matching both criteria simultaneously.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Group C and Integration_of_Functions of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are:  
- Group is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We need respondents with Group ""C"" which corresponds to ""Middle"".  
- Integration_of_Functions is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the functions are well integrated. We want respondents with Integration_of_Functions = 5.  
- The respondents listed are Respondent84 (Group A, Integration_of_Functions 3), Respondent67 (Group C, Integration_of_Functions 5), and Respondent87 (Group B, Integration_of_Functions 5).  
- Only Respondent67 matches both criteria: Group C (Middle) and Integration_of_Functions 5.
