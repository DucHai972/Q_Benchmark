<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 4 and Integration_of_Functions of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant to the question are as follows:  
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the desire to use the system frequently.  
- Integration_of_Functions is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, indicating how well the various functions in the system are integrated, with 5 being Strongly Agree.  
- Respondent data includes these values explicitly for each individual.  
- We need to identify respondents with Frequent_Usage exactly 4 and Integration_of_Functions exactly 5.  
- The respondents available are 3, 4, and 31 with their respective values for these fields.

Checking the data:  
- Respondent 3: Frequent_Usage = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4 (No)  
- Respondent 4: Frequent_Usage = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (Yes)  
- Respondent 31: Frequent_Usage = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 3 (No)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity.  
- Need_for_Technical_Support is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that technical support is needed, indicating low need for support.  
- Respondents with System_Complexity of 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support of 1 are those who find the system not complex and do not feel they need technical support.  
- The responses section lists three respondents with their respective values for these fields.  
- Only respondents meeting both criteria (System_Complexity = 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support = 1) should be selected.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Integration_of_Functions of 5 and Ease_of_Learning of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are:  
- Integration_of_Functions is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. We are looking for respondents with a value of 5, indicating strong agreement that the functions are well integrated.  
- Ease_of_Learning is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 5 meaning Strongly Agree that most people would learn to use the system very quickly. We want respondents with a value of 5 here as well.  
- Respondent numbers are identified by the <h2> tags and are numeric.  
- The responses section provides the actual values for each respondent for these fields.  

Now, checking the respondents:  
- Respondent 32: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5  
- Respondent 16: Integration_of_Functions = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 4 (does not meet criteria)  
- Respondent 77: Integration_of_Functions = 3, Ease_of_Learning = 5 (does not meet criteria)  

Only Respondent 32 meets both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Inconsistency of 1 and Cumbersome_to_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The fields ""Inconsistency"" and ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" are measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree."" For ""Inconsistency,"" a value of 1 indicates the respondent strongly disagrees that there is too much inconsistency in the system, implying they find the system consistent. For ""Cumbersome_to_Use,"" a value of 1 means the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is awkward to use, implying ease of use. The question asks for respondents who rated both these fields as 1, indicating they find the system consistent and not cumbersome.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 20 has Inconsistency = 3 and Cumbersome_to_Use = 2 (does not qualify).  
- Respondent 65 has Inconsistency = 1 and Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 (qualifies).  
- Respondent 84 has Inconsistency = 1 but Cumbersome_to_Use = 3 (does not qualify).

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 4 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- System_Complexity is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex, and 5 means Strongly Agree.  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree that a lot of learning was needed before use, and 5 means Strongly Agree.  
- We are looking for respondents who rated System_Complexity as 4 (indicating they somewhat agree the system is unnecessarily complex) and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 5 (strongly agree they needed to learn a lot before use).  
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.  
- Only respondents matching both criteria exactly should be selected.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 5 and Ease_of_Use of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree to the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex.""  
Ease_of_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree to the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use.""  
We are looking for respondents who rated System_Complexity as 5 (strongly agree that the system is unnecessarily complex) and Ease_of_Use as 2 (disagree that the system was easy to use).  
From the responses, only Respondent 39 has System_Complexity = 5 and Ease_of_Use = 2.  
Other respondents do not meet both criteria simultaneously.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Inconsistency of 4 and Confidence_in_Use of 2?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- ""Inconsistency"" is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.""  
- ""Confidence_in_Use"" is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree to the statement ""I felt very confident using the system.""  
- The question asks for respondents who have an Inconsistency score of exactly 4 and a Confidence_in_Use score of exactly 2.  
- The responses section lists three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.  
- Only Respondent 45 has Inconsistency = 4 and Confidence_in_Use = 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 4 and Confidence_in_Use of 4?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Frequent_Usage is measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).  
- Confidence_in_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).  
- We need to find respondents with Frequent_Usage = 4 and Confidence_in_Use = 4.  
- Respondent data shows these values explicitly for each respondent.  
- Only respondents matching both criteria exactly should be selected.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 57: Frequent_Usage = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 2 (No)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Ease_of_Use of 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are from the Likert scale questions, which range from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. For Ease_of_Use, a value of 5 indicates the respondent strongly agrees that the system was easy to use. For Cumbersome_to_Use, a value of 1 means the respondent strongly disagrees that the system was awkward to use, implying ease of use. The question asks for respondents who have Ease_of_Use = 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 simultaneously. The responses section lists three respondents with their respective values for these fields.

Respondent 55 has Ease_of_Use = 4, so does not qualify.  
Respondent 87 has Ease_of_Use = 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, qualifies.  
Respondent 88 has Ease_of_Use = 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, qualifies.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 1 and Integration_of_Functions of 4?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the desire to use the system frequently.  
- Integration_of_Functions is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree about the functions being well integrated.  
- Respondent data shows these values explicitly for each individual.  
- We need to find respondents with Frequent_Usage = 1 and Integration_of_Functions = 4.  
- Only Respondent 16 has Frequent_Usage of 1 and Integration_of_Functions of 4.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 4 and Ease_of_Learning of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex, and 5 means Strongly Agree. Ease_of_Learning is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree that most people would learn to use the system quickly, and 5 means Strongly Agree. The question asks for respondents with System_Complexity = 4 and Ease_of_Learning = 5. From the responses, only Respondent 37 has System_Complexity = 4 and Ease_of_Learning = 5.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 3 and Confidence_in_Use of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are for the fields Frequent_Usage and Confidence_in_Use, both measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. We need to identify respondents whose Frequent_Usage is exactly 3 and Confidence_in_Use is exactly 5. The dataset includes three respondents: 23, 85, and 35. Their values for these fields are: Respondent 23 has Frequent_Usage 1 and Confidence_in_Use 4; Respondent 85 has Frequent_Usage 3 and Confidence_in_Use 5; Respondent 35 has Frequent_Usage 3 and Confidence_in_Use 5. Therefore, respondents 85 and 35 meet the criteria.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- Group is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.  
- Ease_of_Use is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  
- We need to find respondents whose Group is ""Senior"" (corresponding to A) and whose Ease_of_Use score is exactly 4.  
- The respondents listed are 13, 20, and 64 with their respective Group and Ease_of_Use values.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Confidence_in_Use of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity perception. Confidence_in_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the respondent felt very confident using the system. The question asks for respondents with System_Complexity = 1 (low perceived complexity) and Confidence_in_Use = 5 (high confidence). The respondents and their values are:  
- Respondent 56: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5  
- Respondent 10: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 4  
- Respondent 80: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 3  

Only Respondent 56 meets both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Integration_of_Functions is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), indicating how well the respondent felt the system's functions were integrated.  
- Cumbersome_to_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), reflecting how awkward the respondent found the system to use.  
- We are looking for respondents who strongly agree that the functions are well integrated (score of 5) and strongly disagree that the system is cumbersome to use (score of 1).  
- The relevant respondents are those with Integration_of_Functions = 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use = 1.  
- The respondents and their scores must be checked carefully from the responses section.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 39: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Cumbersome_to_Use = 5 (does not qualify)  
- Respondent 90: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 (qualifies)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Need_for_Technical_Support of 3 and Confidence_in_Use of 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- Need_for_Technical_Support is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding needing technical support.  
- Confidence_in_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, indicating how confident the respondent felt using the system, with 5 being Strongly Agree.  
- We need to identify respondents whose Need_for_Technical_Support score is exactly 3 and Confidence_in_Use score is exactly 4.  
- The respondents and their scores are listed under the Responses section.  
- Only respondents matching both criteria simultaneously should be included in the answer.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent 32: Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Confidence_in_Use = 4  
- Respondent 42: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 4  
- Respondent 72: Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Confidence_in_Use = 1  

Only Respondent 32 meets both criteria.

- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), indicating how much the respondent would like to use the system frequently.  
- Integration_of_Functions is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, measuring how well the respondent found the various functions in the system were integrated.  
- Respondent data includes numeric values for these fields, so exact matches to 3 for Frequent_Usage and 5 for Integration_of_Functions are required.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Ease_of_Learning of 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
""Ease_of_Learning"" is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree, indicating how quickly most people would learn to use the system.  
""Cumbersome_to_Use"" is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree, indicating how awkward the system is to use.  
We are looking for respondents who rated ""Ease_of_Learning"" as 5 (strongly agree that most people would learn quickly) and ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" as 1 (strongly disagree that the system is awkward).  
From the responses, these values are explicitly listed for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Group A and System_Complexity of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are:  
- Group is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.  
- System_Complexity is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree.  
- We need to identify respondents whose Group is ""Senior"" (corresponding to A) and whose System_Complexity score is 1 (Strongly Disagree).  
- The respondents listed are 70, 90, and 23 with their respective Group and System_Complexity values.  
- Only respondents with Group A (Senior) and System_Complexity = 1 qualify.

Respondent 90 has Group A (Senior) and System_Complexity 1.  
Respondent 70 has Group C (Middle), so does not qualify.  
Respondent 23 has Group C (Middle), so does not qualify.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- System_Complexity is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity.  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also rated 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the respondent needed to learn a lot before using the system, indicating minimal learning required.  
- Respondents with System_Complexity of 1 perceive the system as not complex.  
- Respondents with Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 1 felt they did not need much learning before use.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Ease_of_Learning of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity.  
- Ease_of_Learning is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that most people would learn to use the system very quickly, indicating high ease of learning.  
- Respondents with System_Complexity of 1 find the system not complex, and those with Ease_of_Learning of 5 believe it is very easy to learn.  
- The relevant respondents must have both System_Complexity = 1 and Ease_of_Learning = 5 simultaneously.  
- The data includes three respondents: 16, 6, and 56, with their respective values for these fields.

- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Cumbersome_to_Use of 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not find the system awkward to use) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the respondent finds the system very awkward to use).  
- ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not think they need technical support) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the respondent thinks they need technical support).  
- The question asks for respondents who have a value of 1 for both ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" and ""Need_for_Technical_Support,"" indicating they find the system not awkward to use and do not need technical support.  
- The respondents listed are 13, 76, and 39, with their respective values for these fields provided.  
- Only respondents with both values equal to 1 should be selected.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent 13: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1  
- Respondent 76: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1  
- Respondent 39: Cumbersome_to_Use = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 5 (does not meet criteria)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 3 and Inconsistency of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 3 means a neutral or moderate agreement to ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently.""  
- Inconsistency is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 2 indicates slight disagreement with ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.""  
- Respondent data includes these values explicitly for each respondent.  
- We need to find respondents whose Frequent_Usage equals 3 and Inconsistency equals 2.  
- The MCQ field ""Group"" is not relevant here, and no mapping is needed for these numeric Likert values.

From the responses:  
- Respondent 32: Frequent_Usage = 3, Inconsistency = 5 (No)  
- Respondent 72: Frequent_Usage = 1, Inconsistency = 5 (No)  
- Respondent 54: Frequent_Usage = 3, Inconsistency = 2 (Yes)

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Ease_of_Learning of 5 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Ease_of_Learning is measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), indicating how quickly respondents think most people would learn to use the system.  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, representing how much respondents felt they needed to learn before using the system.  
- We are looking for respondents with Ease_of_Learning = 5 (strong agreement that most people would learn quickly) and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2 (disagreement or slight disagreement about needing to learn a lot before use).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 5 and Integration_of_Functions of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to liking to use the system frequently.  
- Integration_of_Functions is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the functions are well integrated.  
- Respondents with a value of 5 in both fields indicate strong positive agreement on frequent usage and good integration of functions.  
- The respondents listed are 76, 20, and 78 with their respective values for these fields.  
- Only respondents with both values exactly equal to 5 should be selected.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 1 and Integration_of_Functions of 4?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the desire to use the system frequently.  
- Integration_of_Functions is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree about the functions being well integrated.  
- Respondent data includes these values explicitly as integers.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Inconsistency of 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Inconsistency is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent thought there was not too much inconsistency) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (there was too much inconsistency).  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (the respondent did not need to learn a lot before using the system) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (needed to learn a lot).  
- The question asks for respondents with Inconsistency = 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, meaning respondents who perceived low inconsistency and low need to learn before use.  
- All respondents in the data have Inconsistency = 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1 except where otherwise noted.  
- The respondents to check are 28, 73, and 87.

Checking responses:  
- Respondent 28: Inconsistency = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1  
- Respondent 73: Inconsistency = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1  
- Respondent 87: Inconsistency = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1

All three respondents meet the criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Group C and Integration_of_Functions of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Group is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.  
- Integration_of_Functions is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  
- We need to find respondents whose Group is ""Middle"" (corresponding to C) and whose Integration_of_Functions score is 5.  
- Respondent data includes these fields explicitly, so we can directly match the values.  
- Only respondents meeting both criteria should be listed.
