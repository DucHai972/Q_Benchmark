<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 4 and Integration_of_Functions of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- Frequent_Usage is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree.
- Integration_of_Functions is also measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with the same scale meaning.
- We are looking for respondents who rated Frequent_Usage exactly 4 (Agree) and Integration_of_Functions exactly 5 (Strongly Agree).
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.
- Only respondents matching both criteria simultaneously should be selected.

Checking the responses:
- Respondent 3: Frequent_Usage = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4 → Does not match.
- Respondent 4: Frequent_Usage = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5 → Matches.
- Respondent 31: Frequent_Usage = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 3 → Does not match.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- System_Complexity is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity.  
- Need_for_Technical_Support is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that technical support is needed, indicating low need for support.  
- Respondents with System_Complexity = 1 perceive the system as not complex.  
- Respondents with Need_for_Technical_Support = 1 feel they do not need technical support to use the system.  
- The question asks for respondents who meet both criteria simultaneously.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Integration_of_Functions of 5 and Ease_of_Learning of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Integration_of_Functions is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), indicating how well the respondent found the functions integrated.  
- Ease_of_Learning is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, reflecting how quickly the respondent imagines most people would learn to use the system.  
- We are looking for respondents who rated both Integration_of_Functions and Ease_of_Learning as 5, meaning they strongly agree the functions are well integrated and that the system is easy to learn.  
- The responses show three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.  
- Only respondents with both values exactly equal to 5 meet the criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

Which respondent numbers have Inconsistency of 1 and Cumbersome_to_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- ""Inconsistency"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system,"" indicating low inconsistency.
- ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" with the statement ""I found the system very awkward to use,"" indicating the system is not cumbersome.
- We need to find respondents whose answers for both ""Inconsistency"" and ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" are exactly 1.
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective answers.
- We will check each respondent's values for these two fields to identify matches.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 4 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- System_Complexity is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), indicating how complex the respondent found the system. A value of 4 means the respondent somewhat agrees that the system is unnecessarily complex.  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means the respondent strongly agrees that they needed to learn a lot before using the system.  
- Both values are numeric strings in the responses.  
- The question asks for respondents with System_Complexity = 4 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 5.  
- Only respondent 57 matches these criteria.

Which respondent numbers have Group C and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- ""Group"" is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree.
- We need to find respondents whose Group is ""Middle"" (corresponding to C) and whose Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score is 1.
- The responses section contains three respondents: 36, 57, and 68.
- We will check each respondent's Group and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use values accordingly.

Respondent 36: Group B (Junior), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1  
Respondent 57: Group C (Middle), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 5  
Respondent 68: Group C (Middle), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 1 and Group C?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" regarding the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently.""  
- Group is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.  
- We need to find respondents whose Frequent_Usage value is exactly 1 and whose Group is ""C"" (Middle).  
- The responses show three respondents: 60 (Group D, Frequent_Usage 5), 50 (Group D, Frequent_Usage 5), and 23 (Group C, Frequent_Usage 1).  
- Only respondent 23 matches both criteria.

- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Group B and Confidence_in_Use of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:
- ""Group"" is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- ""Confidence_in_Use"" is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to feeling very confident using the system.
- We need to identify respondents whose Group is ""Junior"" (corresponding to B) and whose Confidence_in_Use score is 5.
- The responses show three respondents: 52 (Group B, Confidence_in_Use 1), 40 (Group A, Confidence_in_Use 3), and 81 (Group B, Confidence_in_Use 5).
- Only respondent 81 meets both criteria: Group B (Junior) and Confidence_in_Use 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- ""Inconsistency"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.""  
- ""Confidence_in_Use"" is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree regarding the statement ""I felt very confident using the system.""

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Ease_of_Use of 5 and Cumbersome_to_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Ease_of_Use is measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), where 5 means the respondent thought the system was very easy to use.  
- Cumbersome_to_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means the respondent strongly disagreed that the system was awkward to use (i.e., they found it not cumbersome).  
- We are looking for respondents who rated Ease_of_Use as 5 (very easy to use) and Cumbersome_to_Use as 1 (not awkward to use).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Group D and Ease_of_Use of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- ""Group"" is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We need to identify respondents with Group ""D"" which corresponds to ""Intern"".  
- ""Ease_of_Use"" is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system was easy to use. We need respondents with Ease_of_Use = 5.  
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective Group and Ease_of_Use values.  
- Only respondents with Group ""D"" (Intern) and Ease_of_Use = 5 should be selected.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Group B and Ease_of_Use of 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are:  
- Group is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We need to identify respondents with Group B, which corresponds to ""Junior"".  
- Ease_of_Use is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. We are looking for respondents with Ease_of_Use equal to 4.  
- The responses section contains three respondents: 75, 80, and 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- Frequent_Usage is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree.
- Confidence_in_Use is also measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 meaning Strongly Disagree and 5 meaning Strongly Agree.
- We are looking for respondents who rated Frequent_Usage exactly as 3 and Confidence_in_Use exactly as 5.
- The responses show three respondents: 23, 85, and 35.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Ease_of_Use of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- System_Complexity is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity perception.  
- Ease_of_Use is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" that the system was easy to use.  
- We are looking for respondents who rated System_Complexity as 1 (indicating they do not find the system complex) and Ease_of_Use as 5 (indicating they find the system very easy to use).  
- The responses contain three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.  
- Only respondents meeting both criteria simultaneously should be listed.

- ""Group"" is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- ""Ease_of_Use"" is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.
- We need to identify respondents whose Group is ""Senior"" (corresponding to ""A"") and whose Ease_of_Use score is exactly 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- Frequent_Usage is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently.""  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.""  
- The question asks for respondents who answered 1 (Strongly Disagree) for both Frequent_Usage and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use.  
- From the responses, only respondent 24 has Frequent_Usage = 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.  
- Respondents 39 and 78 do not meet both criteria simultaneously.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Group C and Frequent_Usage of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:
- Group is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- Frequent_Usage is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree.
- We need to identify respondents whose Group is ""Middle"" (corresponding to ""C"") and whose Frequent_Usage is ""1"" (Strongly Disagree).
- The responses to check are respondents 31, 24, and 23.
- Only respondents with Group ""C"" and Frequent_Usage ""1"" should be selected.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have System_Complexity of 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is unnecessarily complex, indicating low complexity.  
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the respondent needed to learn a lot before using the system, indicating minimal learning required.  
- The question asks for respondents who rated System_Complexity as 1 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1, meaning they found the system not complex and easy to start using without much prior learning.  
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.  
- Only respondents meeting both criteria simultaneously should be listed.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Group B and Frequent_Usage of 3?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- ""Group"" is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- ""Frequent_Usage"" is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.
- We need to identify respondents whose Group is ""Junior"" (corresponding to B) and whose Frequent_Usage score is exactly 3.
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective Group and Frequent_Usage values.
- Only respondents with Group ""B"" and Frequent_Usage ""3"" should be selected.

From the data:
- Respondent 85: Group A (Senior), Frequent_Usage 3 → No
- Respondent 54: Group B (Junior), Frequent_Usage 3 → Yes

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Cumbersome_to_Use of 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not find the system awkward to use) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the system is very awkward to use).
- ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent does not think they need technical support) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (i.e., the respondent thinks they need technical support).
- The question asks for respondents who rated both ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" and ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" as 1, indicating they find the system not awkward to use and do not need technical support.
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective answers for these fields.
- Only respondents with both values equal to 1 should be selected.

Checking the responses:

- Respondent 13: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1 → matches
- Respondent 76: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1 → matches

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Inconsistency of 5 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 4?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are as follows:  
- ""Inconsistency"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.""  
- ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree with the statement ""I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.""  
- The question asks for respondents who have an Inconsistency score of 5 and a Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score of 4.  
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.  
- Only respondents matching both criteria exactly should be included in the answer.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent 62: Inconsistency = 5, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 4 (matches)  
- Respondent 5: Inconsistency = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1 (does not match)  
- Respondent 63: Inconsistency = 4, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 5 (does not match)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Need_for_Technical_Support of 1 and Integration_of_Functions of 5?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Need_for_Technical_Support is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent thinks they do not need technical support) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (they do need support).  
- Integration_of_Functions is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (functions not well integrated) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (functions well integrated).  
- The question asks for respondents who strongly disagree that they need technical support (score 1) and strongly agree that functions are well integrated (score 5).  
- From the responses, these values must be matched exactly as ""1"" for Need_for_Technical_Support and ""5"" for Integration_of_Functions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Ease_of_Use of 2 and Confidence_in_Use of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Ease_of_Use is measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), indicating how easy the respondent thought the system was to use.  
- Confidence_in_Use is also on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), reflecting how confident the respondent felt using the system.  
- We are looking specifically for respondents who rated both Ease_of_Use and Confidence_in_Use as 2.  
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.  
- Only respondent 75 has Ease_of_Use = 2 and Confidence_in_Use = 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Frequent_Usage of 2 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of 5?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are from the Likert scale questions, which range from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree and 5 means Strongly Agree. The ""Frequent_Usage"" field measures the respondent's agreement with the statement about wanting to use the system frequently, with 2 indicating a low level of agreement (Disagree). The ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" field measures how much the respondent felt they needed to learn before using the system, with 5 indicating strong agreement (Strongly Agree). We are looking for respondents who answered ""2"" for Frequent_Usage and ""5"" for Need_to_Learn_Before_Use. Among the responses, only respondent 63 matches these criteria.

- ""Inconsistency"" is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (i.e., the respondent thought there was not too much inconsistency) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (there was too much inconsistency).  
- ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" (the respondent did not need to learn a lot before using the system) and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" (needed to learn a lot).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Ease_of_Use of 3 and Ease_of_Learning of 3?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- Ease_of_Use is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree, indicating how easy the system was to use.
- Ease_of_Learning is also on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, indicating how quickly most people would learn to use the system.
- We need to find respondents whose Ease_of_Use equals 3 and Ease_of_Learning equals 3 simultaneously.
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective scores for these fields.
- Only respondent 43 has Ease_of_Use = 3 and Ease_of_Learning = 3.
