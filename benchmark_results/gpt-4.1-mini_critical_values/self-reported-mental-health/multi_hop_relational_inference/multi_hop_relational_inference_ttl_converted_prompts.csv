<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Gender Male and Life satisfaction score of 8?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Gender is a multiple-choice question with options: 1 = Male, 2 = Female.
- Life satisfaction is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = Not satisfied and 10 = Totally satisfied.
- We need to identify respondents with Gender = Male (1) and Life satisfaction = 8.
- From the responses, the relevant respondents with Gender and Life satisfaction values are:
  - Respondent93: Gender 1 (Male), Life satisfaction 7
  - Respondent34: Gender 2 (Female), Life satisfaction 8
  - Respondent82: Gender 1 (Male), Life satisfaction 8
- Only Respondent82 matches both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope score of 3 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability score of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope is measured on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 means ""never"" and 4 means ""very often"".  
- Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability is measured on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Not at all"" and 3 means ""Nearly every day"".  
- We need to identify respondents with Unable to Cope = 3 and Irritability = 1.  
- The responses section lists these scores for each respondent under their respective group responses.  
- Only respondents with both scores matching these exact values should be selected.

Checking the data:  
- Respondent147: Unable to Cope = 1, Irritability = 1 (No)  
- Respondent119: Unable to Cope = 2, Irritability = 1 (No)  
- Respondent87: Unable to Cope = 3, Irritability = 1 (Yes)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Socio-economic status score of 1 and Ethnic identity score of 6?
</task>","The Socio-economic status is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 6, where 1 means ""Very low"" and 6 means ""Very high."" The Ethnic identity is a multiple-choice question with options numbered 1 to 6, where 6 corresponds to ""None of the above."" We need to find respondents with Socio-economic status = 1 and Ethnic identity = 6.

From the responses:
- Respondent106: Socio-economic status 2, Ethnic identity 6 → No (SES ≠ 1)
- Respondent50: Socio-economic status 1, Ethnic identity 6 → Yes
- Respondent73: Socio-economic status 2, Ethnic identity 6 → No

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Happiness score of 8 and Life satisfaction score of 8?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Life satisfaction is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""Not satisfied"" and 10 means ""Totally satisfied"".  
- Happiness is also measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".  
- We need to identify respondents whose Life satisfaction score is exactly 8 and Happiness score is exactly 8.  
- From the responses, these scores are given as numeric values associated with each respondent.  
- Only respondents with both scores matching these exact values should be selected.

From the data:  
- Respondent688 has Life satisfaction 8.0 and Happiness 8.0.  
- Respondent655 has Life satisfaction 6.0 and Happiness 6.0.  
- Respondent724 has Life satisfaction 6.0 and Happiness 5.0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Gender Male and Stress score of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Gender is a multiple-choice question with options: 1. Male, 2. Female.
- Stress is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = At no time, 10 = All the time.
- We need to identify respondents with Gender = Male (1) and Stress = 2.
- From the responses, Gender and Stress values are given as numeric codes and scores.
- Respondents to check are Respondent77, Respondent93, and Respondent141.

Checking the data:

- Respondent77: Gender 1.0 (Male), Stress 2.0
- Respondent93: Gender 1.0 (Male), Stress 3.0
- Respondent141: Gender 2.0 (Female), Stress 4.0

Only Respondent77 matches both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Year of birth score of 2003 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Control Important Things score of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Year of birth is an open-ended numeric field representing the respondent's birth year (e.g., 2003).  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency ""Unable to Control Important Things"" is scored on a Likert scale from 0 to 4, where 0 means ""never"" and 4 means ""very often"".  
- We need to find respondents with Year of birth exactly 2003 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Control Important Things exactly 1 (""almost never"").  
- From the responses, Year of birth values are given as floats (e.g., 2003.0).  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency scores are also floats (e.g., 1.0).

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent78: Year_of_birth 2003.0, Unable_to_Control_Important_Things 1.0  
- Respondent21: Year_of_birth 2005.0, Unable_to_Control_Important_Things 2.0  
- Respondent97: Year_of_birth 2003.0, Unable_to_Control_Important_Things 1.0  

Thus, Respondent78 and Respondent97 meet both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Laughter score of 8 and Enjoyment score of 8?
</task>","The critical values for this question are the Laughter and Enjoyment scores, both measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time."" We need to identify respondents whose Laughter score is exactly 8 and Enjoyment score is exactly 8. From the responses, these scores are directly listed under each respondent's data.

Checking the respondents:
- Respondent8 has Laughter 8 and Enjoyment 8.
- Respondent75 has Laughter 8 but Enjoyment 10.
- Respondent36 has Laughter 9 and Enjoyment 9.

Only Respondent8 matches both criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Gender Female and Happiness score of 7?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Gender is a multiple-choice question with options: 1. Male, 2. Female.
- Happiness is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = At no time, 10 = All the time.
- We need to find respondents with Gender = Female and Happiness = 7.
- From the responses, Gender is given as numeric codes (1.0 or 2.0), which must be mapped to ""Male"" or ""Female"".
- Happiness scores are numeric values; we look for exact value 7.

Checking the responses:

- Respondent84: Gender 2.0 (Female), Happiness 5.0 → No
- Respondent136: Gender 2.0 (Female), Happiness 7.0 → Yes
- Respondent69: Gender 2.0 (Female), Happiness 5.0 → No

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Life satisfaction score of 7 and Depression score of 0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Life satisfaction is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""Not satisfied"" and 10 means ""Totally satisfied"".  
- Depression score is also on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".  
- We need to find respondents with Life satisfaction exactly 7 and Depression exactly 0.  
- From the responses, Life satisfaction and Depression values are numeric and directly comparable.  
- Only respondents with both these exact values qualify.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent29: Life satisfaction 8, Depression 0 → No (Life satisfaction not 7)  
- Respondent75: Life satisfaction 10, Depression 0 → No  
- Respondent69: Life satisfaction 7, Depression 0 → Yes

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Life satisfaction score of 8 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability score of 0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Life satisfaction is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = Not satisfied and 10 = Totally satisfied.
- Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 3, where 0 = Not at all and 3 = Nearly every day.
- We need to find respondents with Life satisfaction exactly 8 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability exactly 0.
- From the responses, Life satisfaction and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability are recorded as numeric values under pred:Life_satisfaction and pred:Irritability respectively.
- Respondents to check are Respondent131, Respondent72, and Respondent135.

Checking each:

- Respondent131: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Irritability = 0.0 → matches criteria.
- Respondent72: Life satisfaction = 6.0, Irritability = 0.0 → does not match Life satisfaction.
- Respondent135: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Irritability = 0.0 → does not match Life satisfaction.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Socio-economic status score of 5 and Anger score of 3?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Socio-economic status is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 6, where 1 = Very low and 6 = Very high.
- Anger is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = At no time and 10 = All the time.
- We need to find respondents with Socio-economic status exactly 5 and Anger exactly 3.
- Respondent data includes these scores explicitly under pred:Socio_economic_status and pred:Anger.
- Only respondents with both values matching these criteria should be selected.

Now, checking the responses:

- Respondent47: Socio-economic status 3, Anger 2 → No
- Respondent103: Socio-economic status 5, Anger 3 → Yes
- Respondent26: Socio-economic status 3, Anger 1 → No

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency Upset by Unexpected Events is measured on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often).  
- Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Feeling Nervous or On Edge is measured on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day).  
- We are looking for respondents with a score of exactly 2 on Upset by Unexpected Events and exactly 1 on Feeling Nervous or On Edge.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Socio-economic status score of 5 and Happiness score of 9?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Socio-economic status is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 6, where 1 = Very low and 6 = Very high.
- Happiness is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = At no time and 10 = All the time.
- We need to find respondents with Socio-economic status exactly 5 and Happiness exactly 9.
- From the responses, Socio-economic status and Happiness values are given as numeric scores.
- Respondents to check are Respondent122, Respondent54, and Respondent94.

Checking each:

- Respondent122: Socio-economic status = 3, Happiness = 10 → No
- Respondent54: Socio-economic status = 5, Happiness = 9 → Yes

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Socio-economic status score of 2 and Stress score of 4?
</task>","The critical values and ranges relevant here are:  
- Socio-economic status is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 6, where 1 = Very low and 6 = Very high.  
- Stress is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = At no time and 10 = All the time.  
We need to find respondents with Socio-economic status exactly 2 and Stress exactly 4.  
From the responses, Socio-economic status and Stress values are given as numeric scores for each respondent.  
Only respondents with both these exact values should be selected.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Control Important Things score of 1 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope score of 3?
</task>","The critical values and ranges for the relevant fields are as follows:  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency scores range from 0 to 4, where 0 means ""never"" and 4 means ""very often.""  
- The specific subquestions of interest are ""Unable to Control Important Things"" and ""Unable to Cope.""  
- We need to find respondents with a score of 1 (""almost never"") for ""Unable to Control Important Things"" and a score of 3 (""fairly often"") for ""Unable to Cope.""  
- The responses section lists these scores for each respondent under their Emotional Regulation Frequency group.  
- Only respondents matching both criteria simultaneously should be identified.

Checking the data:  
- Respondent21: Unable to Control Important Things = 2, Unable to Cope = 3 (No, first value not 1)  
- Respondent58: Unable to Control Important Things = 3, Unable to Cope = 3 (No)  
- Respondent145: Unable to Control Important Things = 1, Unable to Cope = 3 (Yes)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Year of birth score of 2005 and Parental Education Mother score of 11?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Year of birth is an open-ended numeric field representing the respondent's birth year.  
- Parental Education Mother is an open-ended numeric field indicating the number of years of education the respondent's mother received.  
- Respondent data includes these fields explicitly, allowing direct comparison of numeric values.  
- The question asks for respondents with Year of birth exactly 2005 and Parental Education Mother exactly 11.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Parental Education Father score of 12 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability score of 0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Parental Education Father is an open-ended numeric field representing years of education.  
- Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Not at all"" and 3 means ""Nearly every day"".  
- We need to find respondents with Parental Education Father = 12 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability = 0.  
- From the responses, Parental Education Father values are given explicitly for some respondents.  
- Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability values are also given for respondents with group responses.

Checking the data:  
- Respondent2088 has Parental Education Father = 12 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability = 0.  
- No other respondents have Parental Education Father = 12.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Stress score of 3 and Loneliness score of 0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Stress is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".  
- Loneliness is also measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning ""At no time"" and 10 meaning ""All the time"".  
- We need to find respondents whose Stress score is exactly 3 and Loneliness score is exactly 0.  
- From the responses, the Stress and Loneliness scores are given as numeric values for each respondent.  
- Only respondents with Stress = 3 and Loneliness = 0 will be selected.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent115: Stress 4, Loneliness 9 → no  
- Respondent129: Stress 3, Loneliness 0 → yes

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Gender Male and Stress score of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Gender is a multiple-choice question with options: 1 = Male, 2 = Female.
- Stress score is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = At no time, 10 = All the time.
- We need to identify respondents with Gender = Male (1) and Stress = 2.
- From the responses, Gender and Stress values are given as numeric codes and scores respectively.
- Respondents to check are Respondent94, Respondent110, and Respondent92.

Checking the data:

- Respondent94: Gender 1.0 (Male), Stress 4.0 (not 2)
- Respondent110: Gender 2.0 (Female), Stress 4.0 (not 2)
- Respondent92: Gender 1.0 (Male), Stress 2.0 (matches)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Year of birth score of 2004 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope score of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Year of birth is an open-ended numeric field representing the respondent's birth year.  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope is measured on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 means ""never"" and 4 means ""very often.""  
- The question asks for respondents with Year of birth exactly 2004 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope exactly 2.  
- From the responses, Year of birth values are given as numeric values (e.g., 1998.0, 2004.0).  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope scores are also numeric values associated with each respondent's group response.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent144 has Year of birth 2004.0 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope 2.0.  
- No other respondent has Year of birth 2004.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

- Stress score is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = At no time and 10 = All the time.
- Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability is measured on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 = Not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half of the days, and 3 = Nearly every day.
- We need to find respondents with Stress = 4 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability = 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Learning score of 10 and Enjoyment score of 7?
</task>","The critical values for this question are the Learning and Enjoyment scores. According to the schema, both are measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time."" We need to find respondents with a Learning score exactly equal to 10 and an Enjoyment score exactly equal to 7. Reviewing the responses, only Respondent18 has a Learning score of 10 and an Enjoyment score of 7.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Gender Female and Parental Education Father score of 16?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Gender is a multiple-choice question with options: 1. Male, 2. Female.
- Parental Education Father is an open-ended numeric value representing years of education.
- We need to identify respondents with Gender = 2 (Female) and Father’s Parental Education = 16.
- Respondents have parental education grouped under a group response with predicates pred:Father and pred:Mother.
- Only respondents with both these conditions met should be listed.

From the data:

- Respondent138: Gender 1.0 (Male), Father 11.0 → no
- Respondent103: Gender 2.0 (Female), Father 16.0 → yes
- Respondent92: Gender 1.0 (Male), Father 12.0 → no

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

- Gender is a multiple-choice question with options: 1 = Male, 2 = Female.
- Stress is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = At no time, 10 = All the time.
- We need to identify respondents with Gender = Male (1) and Stress = 2.
- From the responses, Gender and Stress values are given as numeric codes and scores.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Life satisfaction score of 10 and Depression score of 0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Life satisfaction is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""Not satisfied"" and 10 means ""Totally satisfied"".  
- Depression score is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".  
- We need to identify respondents with Life satisfaction exactly 10 and Depression exactly 0.  
- From the responses, Life satisfaction and Depression values are given as numeric values for each respondent.  
- Only respondents with Life satisfaction = 10.0 and Depression = 0.0 qualify.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent61: Life satisfaction 10.0, Depression 0.0  
- Respondent15: Life satisfaction 6.0, Depression 0.0 (does not qualify)  
- Respondent14: Life satisfaction 8.0, Depression 0.0 (does not qualify)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Enjoyment score of 0 and Depressive Symptoms Frequency Fatigue score of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Enjoyment is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".
- Depressive Symptoms Frequency Fatigue is measured on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 is ""Not at all"" and 3 is ""Nearly every day"".
- We need to find respondents with Enjoyment = 0 and Depressive Symptoms Frequency Fatigue = 1.
- The Depressive Symptoms Frequency Fatigue score is found under the group :QGDepressive_Symptoms_Frequency with the predicate pred:Fatigue.
- The Enjoyment score is directly under pred:Enjoyment.

Checking the responses:

- Respondent86: Enjoyment 0.0, Fatigue 1.0 → matches criteria.
- Respondent30: Enjoyment 0.0, Fatigue 1.0 → matches criteria.
- Respondent116: Enjoyment 9.0, Fatigue not explicitly given but likely not 1.
- No other respondents have Enjoyment 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Gender Male and Anger score of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Gender is a multiple-choice question with options: 1. Male, 2. Female.
- Anger score is a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = At no time, 10 = All the time.
- We need to identify respondents with Gender = Male (1) and Anger = 2.
- Respondents have their Gender and Anger scores listed in the responses section.
- Only respondents with Gender 1.0 and Anger 2.0 qualify.

Checking respondents:

- Respondent113: Gender 2.0 (Female), Anger 2.0 → No
- Respondent91: Gender 1.0 (Male), Anger 2.0 → Yes
- Respondent68: Gender 2.0 (Female), Anger 3.0 → No

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Anger score of 3 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability score of 0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Anger score is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".
- Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability is measured on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Not at all"" and 3 means ""Nearly every day"".
- We need to find respondents with Anger = 3 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability = 0.
- The Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Irritability corresponds to the predicate pred:Irritability within the Anxiety Symptoms Frequency group.
- The Anger score corresponds to pred:Anger in the main response data.

Now, checking the responses:

- Respondent58: Anger = 2, Irritability = 1 → no
- Respondent51: Anger = 3, Irritability = 0 → yes
- Respondent41: Anger = 3, Irritability = 1 → no

Only Respondent51 meets both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Ethnic identity score of 6 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope score of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Ethnic identity is a multiple-choice question with options 1 to 6, where 6 corresponds to ""None of the above"".  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency scores range from 0 to 4, where 1 means ""almost never"" for the frequency of the feeling.  
- The specific Emotional Regulation Frequency sub-question ""Unable to Cope"" measures how often respondents felt they could not cope with all the things they had to do.  
- We need to find respondents with Ethnic identity = 6 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope = 1.  
- The respondents and their values for these fields are in the responses section.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent108: Ethnic identity 1, Unable to Cope 4 → no  
- Respondent12: Ethnic identity 6, Unable to Cope 1 → yes  
- Respondent119: Ethnic identity 6, Unable to Cope 2 → no

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Emotional Regulation Frequency Upset by Unexpected Events score of 1 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Control Important Things score of 1?
</task>","The critical values and ranges for this question are from the Emotional Regulation Frequency group, where respondents rate how often they experienced certain feelings during the last month on a scale from 0 to 4. Specifically, the two relevant subquestions are: ""how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?"" and ""how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?"" Both are scored from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). We need to identify respondents who scored exactly 1 (""almost never"") on both these items.

From the responses:

- Respondent29: Upset by Unexpected Events = 1.0, Unable to Control Important Things = 1.0
- Respondent106: Upset by Unexpected Events = 0.0, Unable to Control Important Things = 3.0
- Respondent104: Upset by Unexpected Events = 4.0, Unable to Control Important Things = 2.0

Only Respondent29 meets both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Emotional Regulation Frequency Upset by Unexpected Events score of 1 and Depressive Symptoms Frequency Sleep Problems score of 0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency Upset by Unexpected Events is measured on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 means ""never"" and 4 means ""very often"".  
- Depressive Symptoms Frequency Sleep Problems is measured on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Not at all"" and 3 means ""Nearly every day"".  
- We need to find respondents with an Upset by Unexpected Events score exactly equal to 1 and Sleep Problems score exactly equal to 0.  
- The responses section lists these scores for each respondent under their respective group responses.  
- Only respondents with both these exact scores qualify.

Checking the data:  
- Respondent105: Upset by Unexpected Events = 2, Sleep Problems not explicitly listed but since no depressive symptoms group is shown, assume no data or 0. But Upset is 2, so no.  
- Respondent67: Upset by Unexpected Events = 1, but no depressive symptoms data shown, so Sleep Problems unknown.  
- Respondent21: Upset by Unexpected Events = 1, no depressive symptoms data shown, so Sleep Problems unknown.

Since no explicit Depressive Symptoms Frequency Sleep Problems scores are given in the responses, and only the Anxiety and Emotional Regulation groups are shown, none have Sleep Problems score explicitly 0.

Therefore, no respondents meet both criteria based on the provided data.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope score of 2 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Restlessness score of 0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope is measured on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 means ""never"" and 4 means ""very often"".  
- Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Restlessness is measured on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Not at all"" and 3 means ""Nearly every day"".  
- We need to find respondents with Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope = 2 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Restlessness = 0.  
- The respondents and their scores for these two variables are:  
  - Respondent50: Unable to Cope = 2, Restlessness = 0  
  - Respondent58: Unable to Cope = 3, Restlessness = 0  
  - Others have different values.  
- Only Respondent50 matches both criteria exactly.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Anger score of 1 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope score of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Anger score is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency scores are on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is ""never"" and 4 is ""very often"".  
- The specific Emotional Regulation Frequency sub-question ""Unable to Cope"" asks how often the respondent found that they could not cope with all the things they had to do.  
- We need to identify respondents with Anger = 1 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope = 2.  
- The responses section provides these scores for each respondent.

Checking the responses:

- Respondent29: Anger = 1, Unable to Cope = 1 (does not match)  
- Respondent129: Anger = 1, Unable to Cope = 2 (matches)  
- Respondent103: Anger = 3, Unable to Cope = 2 (does not match)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Learning score of 9 and Depressive Symptoms Frequency Anhedonia score of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Learning score is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".  
- Depressive Symptoms Frequency Anhedonia is measured on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 is ""Not at all"" and 3 is ""Nearly every day"".  
- We need to find respondents with Learning score exactly 9 and Depressive Symptoms Frequency Anhedonia score exactly 1.  
- The responses section lists Learning scores and group responses for Depressive Symptoms Frequency, including Anhedonia, for each respondent.  
- Only respondents with both these exact values should be selected.

Checking the responses:  
- Respondent112 has Learning 8.0 and no explicit Anhedonia score given in the data.  
- Respondent56 has Learning 8.0 and no explicit Anhedonia score given.  
- Respondent24 has Learning 9.0 but no explicit Anhedonia score given.  
- No explicit Anhedonia scores are provided for any respondent in the given data.

Since no respondent has a Depressive Symptoms Frequency Anhedonia score of 1 explicitly listed, no respondent meets both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Ethnic identity score of 6 and Parental Education Father score of 4?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Ethnic_identity is a multiple-choice question with options 1 to 6, where 6 corresponds to ""None of the above"".
- Parental_Education_Father is an open-ended numeric value representing years of education.
- We need to find respondents with Ethnic_identity = 6 and Parental_Education_Father = 4.
- From the responses, Ethnic_identity values and Parental_Education_Father values are given for each respondent.
- Only respondents with both conditions simultaneously should be selected.

Checking the responses:

- Respondent4388: Ethnic_identity 6, Father education 12 → no

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Learning score of 6 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Upset by Unexpected Events score of 2?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Learning score is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency Upset by Unexpected Events is measured on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is ""never"" and 4 is ""very often"".  
- We need to find respondents with Learning score exactly 6 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Upset by Unexpected Events score exactly 2.  
- From the responses, Learning scores and Emotional Regulation Frequency Upset by Unexpected Events scores are provided for each respondent.  
- Only respondents matching both criteria simultaneously should be listed.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Stress score of 1 and Depressive Symptoms Frequency Fatigue score of 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question:

- Stress is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".
- Depressive Symptoms Frequency Fatigue is measured on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 is ""Not at all"" and 3 is ""Nearly every day"".
- We need to find respondents with Stress = 1 and Depressive Symptoms Frequency Fatigue = 1.
- The Stress scores for respondents are: Respondent48 (1), Respondent114 (2), Respondent101 (2).
- The Depressive Symptoms Frequency Fatigue scores are not explicitly listed in the responses, so we must check if any respondent has this score of 1.

From the data, only Respondent48 has Stress = 1. However, the Depressive Symptoms Frequency Fatigue score is not provided for any respondent in the given data, so no respondent can be confirmed to have Fatigue = 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Happiness score of 9 and Enjoyment score of 9?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Happiness is measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".  
- Enjoyment is also measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means ""At no time"" and 10 means ""All the time"".  
- We need to identify respondents whose Happiness score is exactly 9 and Enjoyment score is exactly 9.  
- From the responses, the relevant fields are pred:Happiness and pred:Enjoyment for each respondent.  
- The respondents to check are Respondent48, Respondent36, and Respondent149.

Checking the data:  
- Respondent48: Happiness 8, Enjoyment 5 (does not match)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Control Important Things score of 2 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Restlessness score of 0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges relevant to the question are:  
- Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Control Important Things is measured on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 means ""never"" and 4 means ""very often"".  
- Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Restlessness is measured on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 means ""Not at all"" and 3 means ""Nearly every day"".  
We need to find respondents with Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Control Important Things = 2 and Anxiety Symptoms Frequency Restlessness = 0.  
From the responses, these values are explicitly listed for each respondent under their respective group responses.  
Only respondents matching both criteria should be included in the answer.

Checking respondents:  
- Respondent145: Unable to Control Important Things = 1, Restlessness = 2 → no  
- Respondent53: Unable to Control Important Things = 2, Restlessness = 2 → no  
- Respondent80: Unable to Control Important Things = 2, Restlessness = 0 → yes

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Control Important Things score of 3 and Emotional Regulation Frequency Unable to Cope score of 3?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The Emotional Regulation Frequency questions use a Likert scale from 0 to 4, where 0 means ""never"" and 4 means ""very often."" Specifically, the ""Unable to Control Important Things"" and ""Unable to Cope"" scores are both measured on this 0–4 scale. We are looking for respondents who have a score of exactly 3 for both these questions, indicating they ""fairly often"" felt unable to control important things and unable to cope.

From the responses:  
- Respondent64 has Unable to Control Important Things = 1 and Unable to Cope = 2 (does not meet criteria).  
- Respondent106 has Unable to Control Important Things = 3 and Unable to Cope = 3 (meets criteria).  
- Respondent127 has Unable to Control Important Things = 3 and Unable to Cope = 3 (meets criteria).
