<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageWantToWorkWith Go;Python;Rust;Scala?
</task>","The critical values to identify are the ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" field in each respondent's answers. This field is open-ended and contains a semicolon-separated list of programming languages the respondent wants to work with. The target value to match exactly is ""Go;Python;Rust;Scala"". We must count how many respondents have this exact string in their ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" field. There are three respondents in total. Checking each:

- Respondent 29111: ""C#;Go;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;TypeScript"" (does not match)
- Respondent 529: ""Go;Python;Rust;Scala"" (matches exactly)
- Respondent 72793: ""Go"" (does not match)

Only one respondent matches the exact string.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 15?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""YearsCodePro"" represents ""Years of professional coding experience"" and is an open-ended numeric value.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""YearsCodePro"" value is exactly ""15"".
- There are three respondents in the dataset.
- Their ""YearsCodePro"" values are 5, 16, and 15 respectively.
- Only one respondent has ""YearsCodePro"" equal to 15.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have CompFreq C?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""CompFreq"" represents the compensation frequency.
- According to the questions schema, ""CompFreq"" is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Weekly, B. Monthly, C. Yearly.
- The responses section contains six respondents.
- Each respondent's ""CompFreq"" value is either ""B"" or ""C"".
- We need to count how many respondents have ""CompFreq"" equal to ""C"" (Yearly).

Counting respondents with CompFreq ""C"" (Yearly):
- Respondent 371: CompFreq = ""C"" → Yearly
- Respondent 73067: CompFreq = ""B"" → Monthly
- Respondent 468: CompFreq = ""C"" → Yearly
- Respondent 384: CompFreq = ""C"" → Yearly
- Respondent 72878: CompFreq = ""C"" → Yearly

There are 4 respondents with CompFreq ""C"" (Yearly).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Employment A?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The ""Employment"" field is a multiple-choice, multi-select question with options:
  A. Employed, full-time
  B. Employed, part-time
  C. Independent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed
  D. Not employed, but looking for work
  E. Not employed, and not looking for work
  F. Student, full-time
  G. Student, part-time
  H. Retired
  I. Prefer not to say
- The responses for ""Employment"" can be a single value or a list of values.
- We need to count how many respondents have ""A"" (Employed, full-time) included in their Employment answers.
- There are 4 respondents in total.
- Checking each respondent's Employment field for presence of ""A"".

Respondents with Employment A:
- Respondent 352: Employment ""A"" → Employed, full-time
- Respondent 162: Employment ""A"" → Employed, full-time
- Respondent 113: Employment ""A"" → Employed, full-time
- Respondent 73053: Employment ""A"" → Employed, full-time

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have VersionControlSystem A?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The ""VersionControlSystem"" field is a multiple-choice question with options:  
A. Git  
B. Mercurial  
C. SVN  
D. I don't use one  
Responses may contain a single value or a list of values. We need to count respondents who have ""Git"" (option A) listed in their VersionControlSystem answers. There are 4 respondents in total. Checking each:  
- Respondent 446 has [""A"", ""C""] → includes Git  
- Respondent 73144 has ""A"" → Git  
- Respondent 298 has ""A"" → Git  
- Respondent 529 has ""A"" → Git  

All 4 respondents have Git.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have EdLevel E?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""EdLevel"" corresponds to the highest level of education.
- The schema for ""EdLevel"" is a multiple-choice question with options:
  A. Primary/elementary school
  B. Secondary school (e.g. American high school, German Realschule or Gymnasium, etc.)
  C. Some college/university study without earning a degree
  D. Associate degree (A.A., A.S., etc.)
  E. Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)
  F. Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)
  G. Professional degree (JD, MD, etc.)
  H. Other doctoral degree (Ph.D., Ed.D., etc.)
  I. Something else
- The responses contain the ""EdLevel"" field for each respondent.
- We need to count how many respondents have ""EdLevel"" equal to ""E"" (Bachelor's degree).

Counting respondents with EdLevel ""E"":
- Respondent 338: E
- Respondent 73010: E
- Respondent 72939: E
- Respondent 29060: E
- Respondent 72685: E

There are 5 respondents with EdLevel E.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have OrgSize 100 to 499 employees?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""OrgSize"" represents the size of the organization the respondent works in.
- It is an open-ended field, so values are exact text strings.
- The specific value of interest is ""100 to 499 employees"".
- The responses section contains multiple respondents with various ""OrgSize"" values.
- Counting how many respondents have exactly ""100 to 499 employees"" in their ""OrgSize"" field will answer the question.

Counting respondents with OrgSize ""100 to 499 employees"":

- Respondent 73101: OrgSize ""100 to 499 employees""
- Respondent 72647: OrgSize ""20 to 99 employees"" (not counted)
- Respondent 72593: OrgSize ""2 to 9 employees"" (not counted)
- Respondent 63: OrgSize ""I don't know"" (not counted)
- Respondent 73100: OrgSize ""1,000 to 4,999 employees"" (not counted)
- Respondent 29154: OrgSize ""10,000 or more employees"" (not counted)
- Respondent 73076: OrgSize ""2 to 9 employees"" (not counted)
- Respondent 72858: OrgSize ""1,000 to 4,999 employees"" (not counted)

Only one respondent (73101) has OrgSize ""100 to 499 employees"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 10?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCodePro 10?"" are as follows:  
- The field ""YearsCodePro"" is an open-ended field representing years of professional coding experience.  
- The values in ""YearsCodePro"" can be numeric strings or phrases like ""Less than 1 year"".  
- We need to count respondents whose ""YearsCodePro"" value is exactly ""10"".  
- There are 9 respondents in total in the dataset.  
- We will check each respondent's ""YearsCodePro"" value for an exact match to ""10"".

Now, checking each respondent's ""YearsCodePro"":  
1. Respondent 73191: ""13"" → no  
2. Respondent 72802: ""Less than 1 year"" → no  
3. Respondent 72935: ""5"" → no  
4. Respondent 471: ""6"" → no  
5. Respondent 73211: ""12"" → no  
6. Respondent 444: ""5"" → no  
7. Respondent 72929: ""10"" → yes  
8. Respondent 72771: ""2"" → no

Only one respondent (72929) has YearsCodePro exactly 10.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""EdLevel"" represents the highest level of education.
- It is a multiple-choice question with options labeled A through I.
- Option F corresponds to ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"".
- The responses section contains 8 respondents.
- We need to count how many respondents have ""EdLevel"" equal to F.

Counting respondents with EdLevel F:
- Respondent 121: EdLevel E
- Respondent 122: EdLevel F
- Respondent 72829: EdLevel E
- Respondent 72962: EdLevel E
- Respondent 72593: EdLevel E
- Respondent 72913: EdLevel E
- Respondent 73147: EdLevel E

Only respondent 122 has EdLevel F.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have CompFreq B?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have CompFreq B?"" are as follows:  
- The field ""CompFreq"" represents ""Compensation frequency"" and is a multiple-choice question with options:  
  A. Weekly  
  B. Monthly  
  C. Yearly  
- The responses section contains three respondents, each with a ""CompFreq"" value.  
- The values for ""CompFreq"" in the responses are:  
  - Respondent 73038: B (Monthly)  
  - Respondent 319: C (Yearly)  
  - Respondent 72720: B (Monthly)  
- Therefore, the count of respondents with ""CompFreq"" equal to B (Monthly) is 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageWantToWorkWith C;C++;Python;Rust?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are found in the ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" field within the responses. This field is open-ended and lists programming languages the respondent wants to work with, separated by semicolons. The exact string to match is ""C;C++;Python;Rust"". We must count how many respondents have this exact sequence and language set in their ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" answer. Partial matches or different orderings do not count.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have CompTotal 120000.0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""CompTotal"" represents the total compensation and is an open-ended numeric value.
- The question asks for respondents with a ""CompTotal"" exactly equal to 120000.0.
- There are three respondents in the dataset.
- Among them, only one respondent has ""CompTotal"" equal to 120000.0.
- The other respondents have ""CompTotal"" values of 65000.0 and 76000.0 respectively.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageHaveWorkedWith C#;C++;HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Kotlin;PHP;SQL;TypeScript;VBA?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The field ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" is an open-ended list of programming languages each respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons. The question asks for respondents who have worked with the exact set of languages: C#, C++, HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, SQL, TypeScript, and VBA. We must match this exact list in the order and completeness as given. There are three respondents in the dataset. We will check each respondent's ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" field for an exact match to the specified list.

Checking responses:  
- Respondent 285: ""C#;C++;HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Kotlin;PHP;SQL;TypeScript;VBA"" (exact match)  
- Respondent 508: ""C#;JavaScript;Python;Rust"" (does not match)  
- Respondent 308: ""Bash/Shell;C#;Go;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;Python"" (does not match)

Only one respondent matches the exact list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 8?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""YearsCodePro"" represents ""Years of professional coding experience"" and is an open-ended numeric value.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""YearsCodePro"" value is exactly ""8"".
- There are three respondents in the dataset.
- Their ""YearsCodePro"" values are: 8, 3, and 7.
- Only one respondent has ""YearsCodePro"" equal to 8.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 11?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""YearsCodePro"" represents ""Years of professional coding experience"" and is an open-ended numeric value.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""YearsCodePro"" value is exactly ""11"".
- There are 4 respondents in total.
- Their ""YearsCodePro"" values are: 16, 23, 11, and 4.
- Only one respondent has ""YearsCodePro"" equal to 11.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have DevType Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer;System administrator?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The field ""DevType"" is open-ended and lists roles in development separated by semicolons. The question asks for respondents whose ""DevType"" exactly matches the string ""Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer;System administrator"". There are 4 respondents in total. I need to check each respondent's ""DevType"" field for an exact match to this string.

Checking responses:  
- Respondent 72847: ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end"" (No)  
- Respondent 72916: ""Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer;System administrator"" (Yes)  
- Respondent 73120: ""Developer, full-stack;Data or business analyst"" (No)  
- Respondent 73112: ""Developer, back-end;Developer, QA or test;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" (No, missing System administrator)

Only one respondent matches exactly.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- ""YearsCodePro"" is an open-ended field representing the years of professional coding experience.
- The responses contain numeric string values for ""YearsCodePro"" such as ""8"", ""6"", ""5"", ""2"", ""1"", ""9"", etc.
- We need to count how many respondents have ""YearsCodePro"" exactly equal to ""1"".
- There are 7 respondents in total in the dataset.
- Only one respondent has ""YearsCodePro"" equal to ""1"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageHaveWorkedWith Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are found in the ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" field, which is an open-ended list of programming languages each respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons. The question asks specifically for respondents who have worked with the exact set of languages: Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL. This means the respondent's ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" must include all four languages: Bash/Shell, C#, Python, and SQL. The order in the string may matter since the data is a semicolon-separated string, so the exact sequence ""Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL"" must match. There are 8 respondents in total. We need to check each respondent's ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" field for this exact string.

Checking each respondent's ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"":

1. Respondent 513: ""Go;TypeScript"" — does not match.
2. Respondent 29034: ""HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;SQL;TypeScript"" — missing Bash/Shell and C#.
3. Respondent 448: ""HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Ruby;SQL"" — missing Bash/Shell, C#, Python.
4. Respondent 211: ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;TypeScript"" — missing Bash/Shell, Python, SQL.
5. Respondent 73213: ""Bash/Shell;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;SQL;TypeScript"" — missing C# and Python.
6. Respondent 72894: ""Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL"" — exact match.
7. Respondent 73099: ""C#;TypeScript"" — missing Bash/Shell, Python, SQL.

Only respondent 72894 has the exact ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" value ""Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have EdLevel E?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""EdLevel"" corresponds to the highest level of education.
- The schema for ""EdLevel"" is a multiple-choice question with options from A to I.
- Option E corresponds to ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"".
- The responses section contains three respondents with their ""EdLevel"" values.
- We need to count how many respondents have ""EdLevel"" equal to E.

Counting respondents with EdLevel E:
- Respondent 186: EdLevel = E (Bachelor's degree)
- Respondent 72836: EdLevel = C (Some college/university study without earning a degree)
- Respondent 72935: EdLevel = E (Bachelor's degree)

There are 2 respondents with EdLevel E.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 14?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""YearsCodePro"" represents ""Years of professional coding experience"" and is an open-ended field.
- The responses contain numeric values or text such as ""Less than 1 year"" for ""YearsCodePro"".
- We need to count how many respondents have ""YearsCodePro"" exactly equal to 14.
- From the responses, the values for ""YearsCodePro"" are: 8, 14, 5, 21, 10, 10, ""Less than 1 year"", 14.
- Only two respondents have ""YearsCodePro"" equal to 14.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have EdLevel F?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""EdLevel"" corresponds to ""Highest level of education"" with multiple choice options.
- Option F in ""EdLevel"" stands for ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"".
- The responses section contains 9 respondents.
- Each respondent's ""EdLevel"" is given as a single letter code.
- We need to count how many respondents have ""EdLevel"" equal to ""F"".

Counting respondents with EdLevel ""F"":
- Respondent 72959: EdLevel C
- Respondent 72746: EdLevel E
- Respondent 238: EdLevel E
- Respondent 157: EdLevel E
- Respondent 50: EdLevel B
- Respondent 52: EdLevel E
- Respondent 72829: EdLevel E
- Respondent 73021: EdLevel F

Only 1 respondent (73021) has EdLevel ""F"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have OrgSize 500 to 999 employees?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""OrgSize"" represents the size of the organization the respondent works in.
- It is an open-ended field, so values are given as text descriptions.
- The specific value to count is ""500 to 999 employees"".
- There are 10 respondents in total.
- We need to count how many respondents have ""OrgSize"" exactly equal to ""500 to 999 employees"".

Counting respondents with OrgSize ""500 to 999 employees"":
- Respondent 204: ""100 to 499 employees"" → no
- Respondent 73015: ""Just me - I am a freelancer, sole proprietor, etc."" → no
- Respondent 242: ""500 to 999 employees"" → yes (1)
- Respondent 279: ""100 to 499 employees"" → no
- Respondent 72710: ""I don't know"" → no
- Respondent 72801: ""20 to 99 employees"" → no
- Respondent 29150: ""500 to 999 employees"" → yes (2)
- Respondent 72815: ""100 to 499 employees"" → no

Total respondents with OrgSize ""500 to 999 employees"" = 2

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have DevType Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Engineer, data;Data or business analyst?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The field ""DevType"" is open-ended and lists roles in development separated by semicolons. The exact string to match is ""Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Engineer, data;Data or business analyst"". Among the 9 respondents, only one respondent (respondent 368) has this exact DevType value. Other respondents have different DevType values that do not match this full sequence exactly.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have DevType Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""DevType"" is open-ended and contains roles in development separated by semicolons.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""DevType"" includes exactly ""Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist"" as a combined string or both roles together.
- From the responses, only one respondent (ID 157) has ""Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist"" exactly as their DevType.
- Other respondents have different combinations of roles, but none match this exact pair.
- Therefore, the count is based on exact matching of these two roles together.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have DevType Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The ""DevType"" field is open-ended and lists roles in development separated by semicolons.
- We are looking specifically for respondents whose ""DevType"" includes both ""Developer, front-end"" and ""Developer, full-stack"" exactly as spelled.
- There are 6 respondents in total.
- We must check each respondent's ""DevType"" string for the presence of both roles.
- The roles must appear together in the same respondent's ""DevType"" field.

Checking each respondent:

1. Respondent 73096: ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, QA or test;Developer, mobile"" — includes both ""Developer, front-end"" and ""Developer, full-stack"".
2. Respondent 73015: ""Developer, back-end;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;Database administrator;System administrator"" — does not include either front-end or full-stack.
3. Respondent 73137: ""Engineer, data;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;Developer, QA or test;DevOps specialist;Developer, embedded applications or devices;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" — includes ""Developer, full-stack"" but not ""Developer, front-end"".
4. Respondent 186: ""Developer, QA or test;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" — does not include either front-end or full-stack.
5. Respondent 275: ""Developer, back-end;Database administrator;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" — does not include either front-end or full-stack.
6. Respondent 73107: ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack"" — includes both ""Developer, front-end"" and ""Developer, full-stack"".

Count of respondents with both ""Developer, front-end"" and ""Developer, full-stack"": 2

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" is an open-ended text field listing programming languages respondents want to use.
- The target value to match exactly is ""HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Kotlin;TypeScript"".
- There are 4 respondents in total.
- Each respondent's ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" field must be checked for an exact match to the target string.
- Only exact matches count; partial or reordered lists do not qualify.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have OrgSize 10 to 19 employees?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are found in the ""OrgSize"" field within the responses. ""OrgSize"" is an open-ended field representing the size of the organization the respondent works in. The specific value of interest is ""10 to 19 employees."" Among the responses, this exact string appears only once. Other organization size values include ranges like ""500 to 999 employees,"" ""20 to 99 employees,"" ""10,000 or more employees,"" and so forth, but only one respondent has ""10 to 19 employees.""

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith Ansible;Docker;Kubernetes;Terraform?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are found in the ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"" field, which is an open-ended list of developer tools used by each respondent. The target combination is the exact string ""Ansible;Docker;Kubernetes;Terraform"" appearing in that field. The responses contain multiple tools separated by semicolons, so the match must be exact and complete for all four tools in that order and no extras. There are 5 respondents in total. We need to count how many have exactly ""Ansible;Docker;Kubernetes;Terraform"" as their tools.

Checking each respondent's ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"":
- Respondent 437: ""npm"" → no
- Respondent 72730: ""Docker;npm"" → no
- Respondent 73099: ""Docker;Kubernetes;npm;Terraform;Yarn"" → no (missing Ansible, has extras)
- Respondent 73148: ""Docker"" → no
- Respondent 238: ""Ansible;Docker;Kubernetes;Terraform"" → yes

Only respondent 238 has the exact combination ""Ansible;Docker;Kubernetes;Terraform"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCode 7?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCode 7?"" are found in the ""YearsCode"" field, which is an open-ended field representing the total years of coding experience. The values are numeric strings representing years of experience. We need to count how many respondents have the exact value ""7"" in their ""YearsCode"" field. The dataset contains 11 respondents, and their ""YearsCode"" values vary from 2 to 20 years. Only those with ""YearsCode"" exactly equal to ""7"" should be counted.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCode 40?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCode 40?"" focus on the ""YearsCode"" field, which is an open-ended field representing the total years of coding experience. The values are numeric strings representing years, such as ""20"", ""10"", ""18"", ""40"", etc. The dataset contains multiple respondents with various YearsCode values. We need to identify how many respondents have exactly ""40"" years of coding experience. The ""YearsCode"" field is the only relevant field for this question, and it is open-ended, so exact string matching is required.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith Docker;Terraform?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"" is an open-ended text field listing developer tools used by respondents, separated by semicolons.
- We need to identify respondents who have both ""Docker"" and ""Terraform"" listed in their ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"" answers.
- The dataset contains 10 respondents.
- Checking each respondent's ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"" for the presence of both ""Docker"" and ""Terraform"" exactly.
- Only respondents with both tools mentioned count towards the answer.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageWantToWorkWith C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;TypeScript?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" is an open-ended text field listing programming languages the respondent wants to use.
- The target value to match exactly is ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;TypeScript"".
- Responses may contain multiple languages separated by semicolons; the match must be exact and in the same order and content.
- There are 11 respondents in total.
- We need to count how many respondents have the exact string ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;TypeScript"" in their ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" field.

Now, checking each respondent's ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"":

1. Respondent 29154: ""Bash/Shell;Kotlin;PHP;Python;Swift;TypeScript"" → No
2. Respondent 355: ""Bash/Shell;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;Rust;SQL;TypeScript"" → No (extra languages, order different)
3. Respondent 386: ""Bash/Shell;HTML/CSS;Java;Kotlin;Perl;Python;SQL;TypeScript"" → No
4. Respondent 300: ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;TypeScript"" → Yes
5. Respondent 29031: ""HTML/CSS;TypeScript"" → No
6. Respondent 72783: ""Bash/Shell;Go;HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Julia;PHP;Python;SQL;TypeScript"" → No
7. Respondent 225: ""C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python"" → No
8. Respondent 29143: ""C#;Kotlin"" → No
9. Respondent 72842: ""Go;TypeScript"" → No

Only respondent 300 matches exactly.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have CompTotal 110000.0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""CompTotal"" represents the total compensation and is an open-ended numeric value.
- The responses section contains individual respondents with their respective ""CompTotal"" values.
- We need to identify how many respondents have a ""CompTotal"" exactly equal to 110000.0.
- There are 4 respondents in total in the dataset.
- Only one respondent (ResponseId 491) has a ""CompTotal"" of 110000.0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCode 15?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCode 15?"" are as follows:  
- The ""YearsCode"" field is an open-ended field representing the total years of coding experience.  
- The responses contain numeric string values for ""YearsCode"" such as ""22"", ""26"", ""9"", ""15"", ""11"", ""18"", ""30"", and ""15"".  
- We need to count how many respondents have exactly ""15"" years of coding experience.  
- There are 9 respondents in total in the dataset.  
- The relevant values to check are the ""YearsCode"" values in each respondent's answers.

Counting respondents with YearsCode = ""15"":  
- Respondent 540 has YearsCode ""15""  
- Respondent 73140 has YearsCode ""15""  

No other respondents have YearsCode ""15"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageHaveWorkedWith Assembly;C;PHP;Python;R;SQL?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" is an open-ended text field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" exactly matches the string ""Assembly;C;PHP;Python;R;SQL"".
- The comparison should be exact, including order and separators, as no instruction was given to consider partial or unordered matches.
- There are 6 respondents in total in the dataset.
- Only one respondent (respondent 450) has ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" exactly as ""Assembly;C;PHP;Python;R;SQL"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have OrgSize 20 to 99 employees?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have OrgSize 20 to 99 employees?"" are found in the ""OrgSize"" field within the responses. The ""OrgSize"" field is open-ended and represents the size of the organization the respondent works in. The specific value to count is ""20 to 99 employees."" Among the six respondents, we need to identify those whose ""OrgSize"" exactly matches this value. The relevant responses are:

- Respondent 42: OrgSize ""20 to 99 employees""
- Respondent 168 (from the example, not in this dataset)
- Others have different OrgSize values.

In this dataset, only respondent 42 has ""20 to 99 employees"" as OrgSize.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have EdLevel C?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""EdLevel"" corresponds to ""Highest level of education"" and is a multiple-choice question with options:
  A. Primary/elementary school
  B. Secondary school (e.g. American high school, German Realschule or Gymnasium, etc.)
  C. Some college/university study without earning a degree
  D. Associate degree (A.A., A.S., etc.)
  E. Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)
  F. Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)
  G. Professional degree (JD, MD, etc.)
  H. Other doctoral degree (Ph.D., Ed.D., etc.)
  I. Something else
- The responses section contains 5 respondents.
- We need to count how many respondents have ""EdLevel"" equal to ""C"" (Some college/university study without earning a degree).

Checking each respondent's EdLevel:
- Respondent 73106: EdLevel = C
- Respondent 355: EdLevel = F
- Respondent 334: EdLevel = F
- Respondent 29047: EdLevel = E
- Respondent 326: EdLevel = E

Only one respondent has EdLevel C.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

How many respondents have DevType Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges:  
The field ""DevType"" is open-ended and describes roles in development. One of the possible roles is ""Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.)"". To answer the question, we need to count how many respondents have this exact role listed in their ""DevType"" answer. The responses section contains four respondents, and we must check each ""DevType"" field for the presence of ""Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.)"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageWantToWorkWith C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" is an open-ended text field listing programming languages the respondent wants to use.
- We are looking specifically for respondents whose ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" value exactly matches ""C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python"".
- The responses section contains 10 respondents.
- Each respondent's ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" field varies; some have multiple languages separated by semicolons.
- We must count only those respondents whose ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" exactly equals the specified string.

After checking all responses, only one respondent (ResponseId 225) has ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" as ""C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 11?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCodePro 11?"" focus on the ""YearsCodePro"" field, which is an open-ended field representing the years of professional coding experience. The responses section contains six respondents, each with a ""YearsCodePro"" value. We need to identify how many respondents have the exact value ""11"" for ""YearsCodePro"". The values present are: 13, 11, 4, 7, 9, and 11. Thus, the critical value is ""11"" and we count how many times it appears.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have CompTotal 96300.0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The field ""CompTotal"" represents the total compensation and is an open-ended numeric value.
- The question asks for the count of respondents with a specific ""CompTotal"" value of 96300.0.
- There are three respondents in the dataset.
- Among them, only one respondent has ""CompTotal"" exactly equal to 96300.0.
- The other respondents have different ""CompTotal"" values (18300.0 and 300000000.0).
