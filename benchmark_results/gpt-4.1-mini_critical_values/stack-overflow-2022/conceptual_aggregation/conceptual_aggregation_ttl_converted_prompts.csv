</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 15?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCodePro 15?"" are as follows:  
- The field YearsCodePro represents ""Years of professional coding experience"" and is an open-ended numeric value.  
- The responses section contains three respondents with YearsCodePro values: 5, 16, and 15.  
- Specifically, Respondent73037 has YearsCodePro ""15"".  
- No other respondents have YearsCodePro exactly equal to 15.  
- Therefore, the count of respondents with YearsCodePro 15 is based on this single match.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Country United States of America?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- The relevant field is ""Country"" which is open-ended and contains the country of residence for each respondent.
- We need to identify respondents whose Country value exactly matches ""United States of America"".
- There are 11 respondents in total.
- The Country values vary and include ""Russian Federation"", ""Canada"", ""Spain"", ""Argentina"", ""United States of America"", ""Czech Republic"", ""Germany"", ""Ireland"".
- Only those with Country ""United States of America"" should be counted.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have CompFreq C?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have CompFreq C?"" are as follows:  
- The field ""CompFreq"" represents ""Compensation frequency"" and is a multiple-choice question with options:  
  A. Weekly  
  B. Monthly  
  C. Yearly  
- The responses contain the ""CompFreq"" value for each respondent, which can be ""A"", ""B"", or ""C"".  
- We need to count how many respondents have ""CompFreq"" equal to ""C"", which corresponds to ""Yearly"".  
- There are 5 respondents in total in the dataset.  
- By checking each respondent's ""CompFreq"" value, we can determine the count.

Now, counting respondents with CompFreq ""C"" (Yearly):  
- Respondent371: CompFreq ""C"" (Yearly)  
- Respondent73067: CompFreq ""B"" (Monthly)  
- Respondent468: CompFreq ""C"" (Yearly)  
- Respondent384: CompFreq ""C"" (Yearly)  
- Respondent72878: CompFreq ""C"" (Yearly)  

There are 4 respondents with CompFreq ""C"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Employment A?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to Employment A:

- Employment is a multiple-choice multi-select field with options:  
  A. Employed, full-time  
  B. Employed, part-time  
  C. Independent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed  
  D. Not employed, but looking for work  
  E. Not employed, and not looking for work  
  F. Student, full-time  
  G. Student, part-time  
  H. Retired  
  I. Prefer not to say

- The responses show Employment values as strings with one or more letter codes separated by semicolons (e.g., ""A"", ""A;C"").

- To count respondents with Employment A, we look for those whose Employment field includes ""A"" (Employed, full-time), either alone or combined with other codes.

- There are 4 respondents in the dataset: Respondent352, Respondent162, Respondent113, Respondent73053.

- All four respondents have Employment values that include ""A"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have VersionControlSystem A?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""VersionControlSystem"" is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Git, B. Mercurial, C. SVN, D. I don't use one.
- Responses may contain multiple codes separated by semicolons (e.g., ""A;C"").
- We need to count respondents who have ""A"" (Git) included in their VersionControlSystem responses.
- There are 5 respondents in the dataset.
- Each respondent's VersionControlSystem value must be checked for the presence of ""A"".

Counting respondents with VersionControlSystem including ""A"":

- Respondent446: ""A;C"" → includes A
- Respondent73144: ""A"" → includes A
- Respondent298: ""A"" → includes A
- Respondent529: ""A"" → includes A

All 4 respondents have ""A"" in their VersionControlSystem.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCode 8?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCode 8?"" are as follows:  
- The field ""YearsCode"" represents the total years of coding experience and is an open-ended numeric value.  
- The responses section contains six respondents with their respective YearsCode values: 6, 7, 22, 8, 7, and 8.  
- Only two respondents have the exact YearsCode value of 8.  
- The question requires counting respondents with YearsCode exactly equal to 8.  
- No letter codes or mappings are needed since YearsCode is open-ended numeric data.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have EdLevel E?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""EdLevel"" corresponds to ""Highest level of education"" and is a multiple-choice question with options labeled A through I.
- Option E is defined as ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"".
- In the responses, the EdLevel field sometimes contains the full text (e.g., ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"") and sometimes other degree levels.
- We need to count how many respondents have EdLevel exactly matching the text for option E.
- There are 10 respondents in total in the dataset.

Counting respondents with EdLevel ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"":

- Respondent338: Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)
- Respondent73010: Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)
- Respondent72939: Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)
- Respondent29060: Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have OrgSize 100 to 499 employees?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to OrgSize in the dataset are as follows:  
The OrgSize field is open-ended and represents the size of the organization the respondent works in.  
From the responses, OrgSize values include ""2 to 9 employees"", ""1,000 to 4,999 employees"", ""10,000 or more employees"", ""100 to 499 employees"", ""20 to 99 employees"", and ""I don't know"".  
The question asks specifically for respondents with OrgSize ""100 to 499 employees"".  
There are multiple respondents with this exact OrgSize value in the responses.

Counting the respondents with OrgSize ""100 to 499 employees"":  
- Respondent73101  
- Respondent73024  
- Respondent73142  
- Respondent268  

There are 4 respondents with OrgSize ""100 to 499 employees"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- The field YearsCodePro represents ""Years of professional coding experience"" and is an open-ended field, so values are given as text or numbers.  
- The responses include values like ""Less than 1 year"", numeric values (e.g., ""2"", ""5"", ""10""), or other text.  
- We need to count respondents whose YearsCodePro value is exactly ""10"".  
- There are 10 respondents in total in the dataset.  
- The relevant values for YearsCodePro in the responses are: ""13"", ""Less than 1 year"", ""5"", ""6"", ""12"", ""5"", ""10"", ""2"".

Now, counting respondents with YearsCodePro exactly ""10"":  
- Respondent72929 has YearsCodePro ""10"".  

No other respondent has YearsCodePro ""10"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have EdLevel F?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""EdLevel"" represents the highest level of education.
- It is a multiple-choice question with options labeled A through I.
- Option F corresponds to ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"".
- In the responses, the EdLevel field contains either the full text of the education level or the letter code.
- We need to count how many respondents have EdLevel exactly matching ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"".

Now, counting respondents with EdLevel F (""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)""):

Respondents with EdLevel ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"":
- Respondent122
- Respondent73147 (No, EdLevel is Bachelor's degree)
- Respondent72829 (No, Bachelor's degree)
- Respondent72962 (No, Bachelor's degree)
- Respondent72593 (No, Bachelor's degree)
- Respondent72913 (No, Bachelor's degree)
- Respondent121 (No, Bachelor's degree)
- Respondent73147 (Yes, Master's degree)
- Respondent122 (Yes, Master's degree)

Wait, carefully checking each:

- Respondent121: Bachelor's degree
- Respondent122: Master's degree
- Respondent72829: Bachelor's degree
- Respondent72962: Bachelor's degree
- Respondent72593: Bachelor's degree
- Respondent72913: Bachelor's degree
- Respondent73147: Bachelor's degree (No, actually ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"")
  
So only Respondent122 has EdLevel F.

No other respondents have EdLevel ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

In the responses, the CompFreq field contains values ""A"", ""B"", or ""C"" corresponding to these options.  
We need to count how many respondents have CompFreq coded as ""B"", which corresponds to ""Monthly"".  
There are three respondents in the dataset, and their CompFreq values are:  
- Respondent73038: B (Monthly)  
- Respondent319: C (Yearly)  
- Respondent72720: B (Monthly)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageWantToWorkWith C;C++;Python;Rust?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" is an open-ended question where respondents list programming languages they want to use.
- The values are semicolon-separated lists of programming languages.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" exactly matches ""C;C++;Python;Rust"".
- The comparison should be exact string match, including order and separators.
- There are 8 respondents in total in the dataset to check.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 8?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to YearsCodePro are found in the responses section under the predicate pred:YearsCodePro, which represents the years of professional coding experience as an open-ended numeric value. The values in the dataset are numeric strings such as ""8"", ""3"", ""7"", etc. To answer the question, we need to count how many respondents have the exact value ""8"" for YearsCodePro.

From the responses:
- Respondent72909 has YearsCodePro ""8""
- Respondent42 has YearsCodePro ""3""
- Respondent73106 has YearsCodePro ""7""

Only one respondent has YearsCodePro equal to 8.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 11?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCodePro 11?"" are as follows:  
- The field YearsCodePro represents ""Years of professional coding experience"" and is an open-ended numeric value.  
- The responses section contains individual respondents with their YearsCodePro values given as strings representing numbers.  
- We need to identify respondents whose YearsCodePro value is exactly ""11"".  
- From the provided data, the YearsCodePro values are: 16, 23, 11, 4 for the four respondents.  
- Only one respondent, Respondent222, has YearsCodePro equal to 11.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have DevType Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer;System administrator?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""DevType"" is open-ended and lists roles in development for each respondent.
- The target DevType value is exactly ""Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer;System administrator"".
- There are 4 respondents in total.
- We need to count how many respondents have the exact DevType string matching the target.
- The DevType values in the responses vary; only one respondent (:Respondent72916) has the exact matching DevType.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 1?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCodePro 1?"" are found in the field pred:YearsCodePro, which is an open-ended field representing the years of professional coding experience. The values are numeric strings indicating the number of years. In the responses, YearsCodePro values vary, including values like ""8"", ""6"", ""5"", ""2"", ""4"", ""1"", and ""9"". We need to count how many respondents have the exact value ""1"" for YearsCodePro.

There are 8 respondents in total. Checking each:

- Respondent29114: YearsCodePro ""8""
- Respondent73213: YearsCodePro ""6""
- Respondent391: YearsCodePro ""5""
- Respondent375: YearsCodePro ""2""
- Respondent29157: YearsCodePro ""4""
- Respondent73120: YearsCodePro ""1""
- Respondent73209: YearsCodePro ""9""

Only Respondent73120 has YearsCodePro ""1"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageHaveWorkedWith Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" is open-ended and contains a semicolon-separated list of programming languages each respondent has worked with.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" value includes exactly the set ""Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL"" (order matters as per the question).
- The dataset contains 10 respondents with their ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" values listed.
- We must check each respondent's ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" field for an exact match to ""Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL"".
- Partial matches or different order do not count; only exact matches count.

Now checking each respondent:

- Respondent513: ""Go;TypeScript"" → no
- Respondent29034: ""HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;SQL;TypeScript"" → no (missing Bash/Shell and C#)
- Respondent448: ""HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Ruby;SQL"" → no (missing Bash/Shell, C#, Python)
- Respondent211: ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;TypeScript"" → no (missing Bash/Shell, Python, SQL)
- Respondent73213: ""Bash/Shell;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;SQL;TypeScript"" → no (missing C# and Python)
- Respondent72894: ""Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL"" → yes (exact match)
- Respondent73099: ""C#;TypeScript"" → no (missing Bash/Shell, Python, SQL)

Only Respondent72894 has the exact ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" value ""Bash/Shell;C#;Python;SQL"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have EdLevel E?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to EdLevel in the dataset:  
The EdLevel question is a multiple-choice question with options from A to I, where E corresponds to ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"".  
Among the respondents, EdLevel values include ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"", ""C"" (Some college/university study without earning a degree), and ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"".  
Only the exact text ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"" corresponds to EdLevel E.  
There are three respondents with EdLevel exactly matching ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 14?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to YearsCodePro in the dataset are as follows:  
- YearsCodePro is an open-ended field representing the years of professional coding experience.  
- Values can be numeric (e.g., ""14"", ""8"", ""10"") or descriptive (e.g., ""Less than 1 year"").  
- The dataset includes a range from less than 1 year up to 21 years in the provided responses.  
- The exact numeric value ""14"" appears explicitly in at least one respondent's data.  
- To answer the question, we count how many respondents have the exact value ""14"" for YearsCodePro.

Counting respondents with YearsCodePro ""14"":  
- Respondent298 has YearsCodePro ""14"".  
- No other respondents have YearsCodePro ""14"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCode 3?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCode 3?"" are as follows:  
- The field YearsCode represents ""Total years of coding experience"" and is open-ended, so the exact numeric value is recorded as text.  
- We need to identify respondents whose YearsCode value is exactly ""3"".  
- From the responses, the YearsCode values are:  
  - Respondent72814: 3  
  - Respondent72959: 25  
  - Respondent73102: 18  
  - Respondent72753: 40  
- Only Respondent72814 has YearsCode equal to 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have EdLevel F?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""EdLevel"" corresponds to ""Highest level of education"" and is a multiple-choice question with options labeled A through I.
- Option F corresponds to ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"".
- The responses contain multiple respondents with their ""EdLevel"" values given either as the letter code or the full text.
- To count respondents with EdLevel F, we must identify those whose EdLevel is exactly ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"".
- There are 11 respondents in total in the dataset.

Counting respondents with EdLevel F:

- Respondent72746: Bachelor's degree (not F)
- Respondent238: Bachelor's degree (not F)
- Respondent157: Bachelor's degree (not F)
- Respondent50: B (Secondary school) (not F)
- Respondent52: Bachelor's degree (not F)
- Respondent72829: Bachelor's degree (not F)
- Respondent73021: Master's degree (F)
- Respondent72959: C (Some college/university study) (not F)

Only Respondent73021 has EdLevel F.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have OrgSize 500 to 999 employees?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to OrgSize in the dataset are as follows: OrgSize is an open-ended field describing the size of the organization the respondent works in. The responses include specific ranges such as ""100 to 499 employees,"" ""500 to 999 employees,"" ""20 to 99 employees,"" ""Just me - I am a freelancer, sole proprietor, etc.,"" ""I don't know,"" and ""100 to 499 employees."" The relevant range for this question is ""500 to 999 employees."" Among the respondents, only those with OrgSize exactly matching ""500 to 999 employees"" should be counted.

There are 2 respondents with OrgSize ""500 to 999 employees"": Respondent204 and Respondent29150.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have DevType Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Engineer, data;Data or business analyst?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""DevType"" is open-ended and lists roles in development for each respondent.
- The target value to count is exactly ""Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Engineer, data;Data or business analyst"".
- Responses may have multiple roles separated by semicolons; only those matching exactly the full string count.
- There are 10 respondents in total.
- We must count how many respondents have the exact DevType string as specified.

Now, checking each respondent's DevType:

1. Respondent368: ""Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Engineer, data;Data or business analyst"" → matches exactly.
2. Respondent362: ""Developer, full-stack"" → no.
3. Respondent55: ""Developer, back-end;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" → no.
4. Respondent29031: ""Developer, front-end"" → no.
5. Respondent72972: ""Developer, back-end;Engineering manager"" → no.
6. Respondent72800: ""Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end"" → no.
7. Respondent222: ""Developer, back-end"" → no.
8. Respondent412: ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications"" → no.

Only Respondent368 matches.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have DevType Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""DevType"" is open-ended and lists roles in development for each respondent.
- We are looking specifically for respondents whose ""DevType"" includes exactly ""Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist"".
- The responses section contains multiple respondents with various ""DevType"" values.
- We must count only those respondents whose ""DevType"" matches ""Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist"" exactly, not those with additional roles.
- The relevant respondents to check are those with ""DevType"" containing these two roles and no others.

Now, checking each respondent's DevType:

- Respondent450: ""Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Developer, full-stack;Educator"" → No
- Respondent61: Multiple roles including ""Developer, back-end"" and others → No (more roles than just the two)
- Respondent73107: ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack"" → No
- Respondent159: ""Engineer, site reliability;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer;System administrator"" → No (missing Developer, back-end)
- Respondent157: ""Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist"" → Yes (exact match)
- Respondent72932: Multiple roles including ""Developer, back-end"" and others → No (more roles than just the two)
- Respondent72904: ""Developer, full-stack"" → No

Only Respondent157 matches exactly ""Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have DevType Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""DevType"" is open-ended and lists roles in development for each respondent.
- We are looking specifically for respondents whose ""DevType"" includes exactly ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack"".
- The responses show multiple roles separated by semicolons; the exact match must be checked.
- There are 7 respondents in total.
- Among them, only those with ""DevType"" exactly equal to ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack"" count.

Counting respondents with DevType ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack"":

- Respondent73096: ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, QA or test;Developer, mobile"" (includes more roles, not exact)
- Respondent73015: ""Developer, back-end;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;Database administrator;System administrator"" (no)
- Respondent73137: ""Engineer, data;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;Developer, QA or test;DevOps specialist;Developer, embedded applications or devices;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" (includes full-stack but not front-end)
- Respondent186: ""Developer, QA or test;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" (no)
- Respondent275: ""Developer, back-end;Database administrator;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" (no)
- Respondent73107: ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack"" (exact match)
  
Only Respondent73107 has exactly ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageWantToWorkWith HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Kotlin;TypeScript?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" is an open-ended question where respondents list programming languages they want to use.
- The target value to match is exactly ""HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Kotlin;TypeScript"".
- There are 4 respondents in the dataset.
- Each respondent's ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" field must be checked for an exact match to the target string.
- The matching must be exact, including order and separators.

Now checking each respondent's ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"":

- Respondent72725: ""C#;Go;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;SQL;TypeScript"" → does not match.
- Respondent72681: ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;SQL"" → does not match.
- Respondent73217: ""JavaScript;Python;TypeScript"" → does not match.
- Respondent288: ""HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Kotlin;TypeScript"" → matches exactly.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have OrgSize 10 to 19 employees?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to OrgSize are found in the question :QOrgSize, which is an open-ended field describing the size of the organization the respondent works in. The responses include various ranges such as ""10 to 19 employees"", ""20 to 99 employees"", ""500 to 999 employees"", ""10,000 or more employees"", etc. The specific value of interest is ""10 to 19 employees"". Among the responses, only one respondent (:Respondent29143) has OrgSize exactly ""10 to 19 employees"". Other respondents have different OrgSize values.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCodePro 4?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCodePro 4?"" focus on the field YearsCodePro, which is an open-ended numeric value representing ""Years of professional coding experience."" The responses section lists individual respondents with their YearsCodePro values as exact numbers. To answer, we must count how many respondents have the exact value ""4"" for YearsCodePro. The relevant respondents and their YearsCodePro values are:

- Respondent365: 20
- Respondent298: 14
- Respondent461: 1
- Respondent29067: 4
- Respondent72626: 18
- Respondent73200: 17
- Respondent72683: 11

Only Respondent29067 has YearsCodePro equal to 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith Ansible;Docker;Kubernetes;Terraform?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"" is open-ended and lists developer tools used by respondents, separated by semicolons.
- The question asks for respondents who have all four tools: Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform listed together in their ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"" response.
- There are 5 respondents in total.
- Checking each respondent's ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"" values for the presence of all four tools is necessary.
- Only exact matches of all four tools together count, regardless of order.

Now, checking each respondent:

1. Respondent437: ""npm"" — does not have all four.
2. Respondent72730: ""Docker;npm"" — missing Ansible, Kubernetes, Terraform.
3. Respondent73099: ""Docker;Kubernetes;npm;Terraform;Yarn"" — missing Ansible.
4. Respondent73148: ""Docker"" — missing Ansible, Kubernetes, Terraform.
5. Respondent238: ""Ansible;Docker;Kubernetes;Terraform"" — has all four.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCode 7?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCode 7?"" are as follows:  
- The field YearsCode represents ""Total years of coding experience"" and is open-ended, so the exact numeric value is recorded as a string.  
- We need to count respondents whose YearsCode value is exactly ""7"".  
- The responses contain YearsCode values such as ""7"", ""6"", ""10"", ""5"", ""2"", ""9"", ""16"", ""20"", etc.  
- Only those with YearsCode exactly equal to ""7"" should be counted, no ranges or approximations.  
- There are multiple respondents with YearsCode ""7"" in the dataset.

Counting respondents with YearsCode ""7"":  
- Respondent72935: 7  
- Respondent143: 20 (no)  
- Respondent72710: 6 (no)  
- Respondent72970: 10 (no)  
- Respondent511: 6 (no)  
- Respondent29157: 16 (no)  
- Respondent73147: 5 (no)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCode 40?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCode 40?"" are as follows:  
- The field YearsCode represents ""Total years of coding experience"" and is open-ended, so it can be any numeric or text value.  
- The responses contain YearsCode values such as 20, 10, 18, 5, 8, 12, 40, etc.  
- Only one respondent, Respondent72753, has YearsCode ""40"".  
- Other respondents have YearsCode values less than 40.  
- The question asks for a count of respondents with exactly 40 years of coding experience.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Country Portugal?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""Country"" is open-ended, meaning the exact text value is recorded for each respondent.
- The question ""Country"" is defined as ""Country: Country of residence [Open-ended]"" in the schema.
- To answer how many respondents have Country Portugal, we must count the number of respondents whose pred:Country value is exactly ""Portugal"".
- There are three respondents in the dataset: Respondent539, Respondent72802, and Respondent72753.
- Among these, only Respondent539 has Country ""Portugal"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith Docker;Terraform?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"" is open-ended and lists developer tools used by respondents, separated by semicolons.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith"" value includes both ""Docker"" and ""Terraform"".
- The presence of these tools must be exact matches within the semicolon-separated list.
- There are 10 respondents in total.
- We will count only those respondents who have both ""Docker"" and ""Terraform"" listed.

Now, checking each respondent's ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith:

1. Respondent72921: ""npm"" — no Docker or Terraform.
2. Respondent72831: ""npm"" — no Docker or Terraform.
3. Respondent396: ""Docker;Kubernetes;npm;Terraform;Unity 3D;Unreal Engine"" — has Docker and Terraform.
4. Respondent72937: ""Docker;Kubernetes"" — has Docker but no Terraform.
5. Respondent115: ""npm;Yarn"" — no Docker or Terraform.
6. Respondent157: ""Docker"" — has Docker but no Terraform.
7. Respondent171: ""Docker;Homebrew;Kubernetes;npm;Terraform"" — has Docker and Terraform.
8. Respondent154: ""Docker;Terraform"" — has Docker and Terraform.
9. Respondent72583: ""Docker;Homebrew;Kubernetes;npm"" — has Docker but no Terraform.

Counting those with both Docker and Terraform: Respondent396, Respondent171, Respondent154.

Total count = 3

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageWantToWorkWith C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;TypeScript?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" is open-ended and contains semicolon-separated lists of programming languages that respondents want to use.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" exactly matches the string ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;TypeScript"".
- The comparison should be exact, including order and separators, as no instruction was given to consider partial matches or reorderings.
- The dataset contains 12 respondents with their ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" values listed.
- We will count how many respondents have the exact ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" value as specified.

Now, checking each respondent's ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"":

- Respondent29154: ""Bash/Shell;Kotlin;PHP;Python;Swift;TypeScript"" → No
- Respondent355: ""Bash/Shell;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;Rust;SQL;TypeScript"" → No
- Respondent386: ""Bash/Shell;HTML/CSS;Java;Kotlin;Perl;Python;SQL;TypeScript"" → No
- Respondent300: ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;TypeScript"" → Yes
- Respondent29031: ""HTML/CSS;TypeScript"" → No
- Respondent72783: ""Bash/Shell;Go;HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Julia;PHP;Python;SQL;TypeScript"" → No
- Respondent225: ""C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python"" → No
- Respondent29143: ""C#;Kotlin"" → No
- Respondent72842: ""Go;TypeScript"" → No

Only Respondent300 matches exactly.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have CompTotal 110000.0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have CompTotal 110000.0?"" are found in the responses section under the field pred:CompTotal, which is an open-ended numeric value representing total compensation. The question schema defines CompTotal as ""Total compensation [Open-ended]"", so exact numeric matches are required. Among the respondents, only one has CompTotal exactly equal to ""110000.0"". Other compensation values differ and do not match this exact figure.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have YearsCode 15?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question ""How many respondents have YearsCode 15?"" are found in the responses section under the predicate pred:YearsCode, which is an open-ended field representing the total years of coding experience. The values are numeric strings representing years of coding experience. We need to count how many respondents have the exact value ""15"" for YearsCode.

From the responses:

- Respondent540 has YearsCode ""15""
- Respondent73140 has YearsCode ""15""

No other respondents have YearsCode ""15"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageHaveWorkedWith Assembly;C;PHP;Python;R;SQL?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" is open-ended and lists programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- We need to identify respondents whose ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" exactly matches the string ""Assembly;C;PHP;Python;R;SQL"".
- The comparison should be exact, including order and content, as no instruction was given to consider partial matches or different order.
- There are 7 respondents in total.
- Only one respondent (:Respondent450) has the exact ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" value ""Assembly;C;PHP;Python;R;SQL"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have OrgSize 20 to 99 employees?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to OrgSize in the dataset are as follows:  
The OrgSize field is open-ended and represents the size of the organization the respondent works in.  
From the responses, OrgSize values include ""100 to 499 employees"", ""20 to 99 employees"", ""500 to 999 employees"", ""100 to 499 employees"", ""500 to 999 employees"", and ""20 to 99 employees"".  
The specific range ""20 to 99 employees"" appears explicitly in the responses of Respondent42 and Respondent72972.  
No other respondents have the OrgSize value ""20 to 99 employees"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have EdLevel C?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to EdLevel in the dataset are as follows:  
The EdLevel question is a multiple-choice question with options labeled A through I, where C corresponds to ""Some college/university study without earning a degree.""  
Among the respondents, EdLevel values appear both as letter codes (e.g., ""C"") and as full text (e.g., ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"").  
For counting respondents with EdLevel C, only those with the exact letter code ""C"" should be considered, matching the schema option ""Some college/university study without earning a degree.""  
In the responses, only one respondent (:Respondent73106) has EdLevel coded as ""C."" All others have different EdLevel values.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have DevType Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.)?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""DevType"" is open-ended and describes the roles in development for each respondent.
- The question asks specifically for respondents whose DevType includes ""Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.)"".
- From the responses, only one respondent (:Respondent248) has ""Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.)"" listed as their DevType.
- Other respondents have different DevType values without this exact role.
- Therefore, the count is based on exact matching of the role ""Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.)"" in the DevType field.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageWantToWorkWith C++;Python;Rust?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" is an open-ended question where respondents list programming languages they want to use.
- The question asks specifically for respondents whose ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" value exactly matches ""C++;Python;Rust"".
- The responses section contains multiple respondents with various values for ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"".
- We need to count only those respondents whose ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" field exactly equals ""C++;Python;Rust"" (case-sensitive and exact match).
- Other respondents with similar but not exact matches (e.g., missing Rust or additional languages) should not be counted.

Now, checking the responses:

- Respondent72856: LanguageWantToWorkWith ""C;C#;HTML/CSS;PHP;PowerShell;SQL;VBA"" → no
- Respondent313: LanguageWantToWorkWith ""C++;Python;Rust"" → yes
- Respondent229: LanguageWantToWorkWith ""HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;Python;SQL;TypeScript"" → no
- Respondent72690: LanguageWantToWorkWith ""Java;JavaScript;SQL;TypeScript"" → no

Only Respondent313 matches exactly.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have LanguageWantToWorkWith C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- The field of interest is LanguageWantToWorkWith, which is an open-ended field listing programming languages respondents want to use.
- We need to find respondents whose LanguageWantToWorkWith exactly matches ""C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python"".
- The responses section contains multiple respondents with various values for LanguageWantToWorkWith.
- We must count only those respondents whose LanguageWantToWorkWith field exactly equals the specified string.
- The schema clarifies that LanguageWantToWorkWith is open-ended, so exact string matching is required.

Now, checking each respondent's LanguageWantToWorkWith:

- Respondent73031: ""F#;Go;Python;R"" → no
- Respondent73124: ""Swift"" → no
- Respondent72836: ""Bash/Shell;C;C++;Java;Python;Rust;SQL"" → no
- Respondent395: ""APL;C;C++;Haskell;Perl;Rust"" → no
- Respondent225: ""C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python"" → yes
- Respondent73100: ""Dart;SQL"" → no
- Respondent73038: ""Bash/Shell;C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;SQL"" → no
- Respondent260: ""Clojure;Go;Python"" → no
- Respondent127: ""JavaScript;Python;SQL"" → no

Only Respondent225 matches exactly.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- The field ""CompTotal"" represents ""Total compensation"" and is open-ended, meaning it contains numeric or text values representing the total compensation amount.
- The responses section contains three respondents with their respective ""CompTotal"" values.
- Among these, only Respondent433 has a ""CompTotal"" value of ""96300.0"".
- The question asks for the count of respondents with this exact ""CompTotal"" value.
- No other respondents have the same ""CompTotal"" value in the provided data.
