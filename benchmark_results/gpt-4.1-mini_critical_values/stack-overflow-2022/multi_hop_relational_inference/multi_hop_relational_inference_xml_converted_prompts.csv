</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have MainBranch A and CompTotal of 67000.0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:
- MainBranch is a multiple-choice question with options including ""A. I am a developer by profession"".
- CompTotal is an open-ended field representing total compensation, given as a numeric value.
- We need to find respondents whose MainBranch answer corresponds to ""I am a developer by profession"" and whose CompTotal is exactly 67000.0.
- From the responses, MainBranch ""A"" maps to ""I am a developer by profession"".
- Checking the respondents, only respondent 73215 has MainBranch ""A"" and CompTotal 67000.0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Employment A and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing Python?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- Employment is a multiple-choice multi-select field with options including ""A. Employed, full-time"".
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose Employment answer is ""Employed, full-time"" and whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Python"".
- From the responses, Employment ""A"" corresponds to ""Employed, full-time"".
- We must check each respondent's Employment and LanguageHaveWorkedWith fields accordingly.

Checking respondents:

- Respondent 297: Employment = A → Employed, full-time; LanguageHaveWorkedWith = Bash/Shell;Python → contains Python.
- Respondent 143: Employment = A → Employed, full-time; LanguageHaveWorkedWith = C++;Julia;Python;Rust → contains Python.
- Respondent 72878: Employment = A → Employed, full-time; LanguageHaveWorkedWith = C#;C++;Dart;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;SQL;TypeScript → does not contain Python.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have EdLevel E and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing Python?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- EdLevel is a multiple-choice question with option E corresponding to ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"".
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose EdLevel is exactly ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"" and whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Python"".
- From the responses, the relevant respondents to check are those with EdLevel E and then verify if ""Python"" is present in their LanguageHaveWorkedWith.
- Respondent 127 has EdLevel ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"" and LanguageHaveWorkedWith ""JavaScript;Python;SQL"", which contains Python.
- Respondents 73038, 72689, and 73059 do not have EdLevel E or do not have Python in LanguageHaveWorkedWith.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have DevType containing Developer, full-stack and ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith containing Docker?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- DevType is an open-ended field listing roles in development; we need to find respondents whose DevType includes ""Developer, full-stack"".
- ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing developer tools used; we need to find respondents whose ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith includes ""Docker"".
- Respondents to check are those in the responses section.
- The relevant respondents are those whose DevType contains the exact phrase ""Developer, full-stack"" and whose ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith contains ""Docker"".
- We must output the respondent IDs matching both criteria.

Checking respondents:

- Respondent 72659: DevType includes ""Developer, full-stack;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications"" and ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith includes ""Docker;npm;Yarn"" → matches both.
- Respondent 73211: DevType includes ""Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;DevOps specialist;Other (please specify):;Cloud infrastructure engineer;Security professional"" and ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith includes ""Docker;npm"" → matches both.
- Respondent 72651: DevType ""Developer, front-end"" (no full-stack) → no.
- Respondent 73103: DevType includes ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;Database administrator;Developer, embedded applications or devices;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" and ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith includes ""Docker;Homebrew;Kubernetes;npm;Unity 3D;Unreal Engine"" → matches both.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Employment A and EdLevel E?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- Employment is a multiple-choice question with options including A. Employed, full-time.
- EdLevel is a multiple-choice question with options including E. Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.).
- We need to find respondents whose Employment answer is ""Employed, full-time"" and EdLevel answer is ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"".
- From the responses, respondent 303 has Employment ""A"" and EdLevel ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"".
- Respondents 455 and 72804 have Employment ""A"" but EdLevel ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"", so they do not match.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have YearsCodePro of 5 and ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith containing Homebrew?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- YearsCodePro is an open-ended field representing years of professional coding experience. We are looking specifically for respondents with a value of ""5"".
- ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing developer tools used, separated by semicolons. We need to find respondents whose list includes ""Homebrew"".
- From the responses, respondent 319 has YearsCodePro = 5 and ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith includes ""Homebrew"".
- Respondent 29115 has YearsCodePro = 18, so does not match.
- Respondent 72835 has YearsCodePro = 7, so does not match.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have EdLevel F and CompTotal of 320000.0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are:  
- EdLevel F corresponds to ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"" as per the questions schema.  
- CompTotal is an open-ended field representing total compensation, here specifically 320000.0.  
- Among the respondents, only respondent 475 has EdLevel ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"" and CompTotal 320000.0.  
- Other respondents have different EdLevel or CompTotal values that do not match both criteria simultaneously.  
- Therefore, the critical matching respondent is 475.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have YearsCode of 15 and ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith containing Ansible?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- YearsCode is an open-ended field representing total years of coding experience.
- ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing developer tools used by the respondent.
- We need to find respondents with YearsCode exactly 15.
- Among those, we must check if their ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith contains ""Ansible"".
- The dataset contains three respondents with YearsCode values 23, 16, and 15 respectively.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have YearsCodePro of 5 and CompTotal of 98000.0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- YearsCodePro is an open-ended field representing years of professional coding experience, so exact numeric matches are required.  
- CompTotal is an open-ended field representing total compensation, requiring exact numeric matches including decimals.  
- Respondent IDs are unique identifiers for each respondent.  
- The dataset contains four respondents with YearsCodePro values of 3, 5, 13, and 1, and CompTotal values ranging from 4600.0 to 3200000.0.  
- Only one respondent has YearsCodePro of 5 and CompTotal of 98000.0.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

Which respondent numbers have LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing Bash/Shell and ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith containing Terraform?

- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing developer tools used by the respondent, separated by semicolons.
- We need to identify respondents whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Bash/Shell"" and whose ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith includes ""Terraform"".
- From the responses, ""Bash/Shell"" appears in respondents 72669, 60, and 72916.
- Among these, only respondents 72776 and 72916 have ""Terraform"" in ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith, but 72776 does not have ""Bash/Shell"" in LanguageHaveWorkedWith, so only 72916 meets both criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have MainBranch A and Employment A?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- MainBranch is a multiple-choice question representing the primary professional identity. Option A corresponds to ""I am a developer by profession.""
- Employment is a multiple-choice multi-select question representing employment status. Option A corresponds to ""Employed, full-time.""
- Respondents have various values for these fields, and we need to identify those with MainBranch as ""I am a developer by profession"" and Employment as ""Employed, full-time.""
- The responses section contains three respondents with IDs 348, 136, and 396.
- Checking their MainBranch and Employment answers will determine which respondents meet both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Employment A and LanguageWantToWorkWith containing C?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- Employment is a multiple-choice multi-select field with options including A. Employed, full-time.
- LanguageWantToWorkWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent wants to use.
- We need to find respondents whose Employment includes ""Employed, full-time"" and whose LanguageWantToWorkWith contains the letter ""C"" as part of any language name.
- The respondents are:  
  - Respondent 379: Employment ""A"" (Employed, full-time), LanguageWantToWorkWith ""Rust;SQL"" (no ""C"")  
  - Respondent 72734: Employment ""A"" (Employed, full-time), LanguageWantToWorkWith ""C;Dart;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;SQL"" (contains ""C"")  
  - Respondent 73038: Employment ""C"" (Independent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed), so does not match Employment A.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have EdLevel F and Country France?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- EdLevel F corresponds to ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"" as per the questions schema.  
- Country is an open-ended field, so the exact text ""France"" must be matched.  
- Among the respondents, only respondent 513 has EdLevel ""Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.)"" and Country ""France"".  
- Other respondents have different EdLevel or Country values.  
- Therefore, only respondent 513 meets both criteria.

Which respondent numbers have LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing Java and ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith containing npm?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing developer tools used, separated by semicolons.
- We need to identify respondents whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Java"" exactly, and whose ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith includes ""npm"" exactly.
- There are three respondents: 72700, 72728, and 29145.
- Among them, only respondent 72700 has ""Java"" in LanguageHaveWorkedWith (""SQL;VBA"" - no Java), 72728 has ""JavaScript"" only, and 29145 has no ""Java"" but has ""C#"" and other languages.

Checking carefully:

- Respondent 72700: LanguageHaveWorkedWith = ""SQL;VBA"" (no Java), ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = ""Docker;Kubernetes"" (no npm)
- Respondent 72728: LanguageHaveWorkedWith = ""JavaScript"" (no Java), ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = ""npm"" (yes)
- Respondent 29145: LanguageHaveWorkedWith = ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;SQL;TypeScript"" (no Java), ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = ""Docker;npm"" (yes)

None of the respondents have ""Java"" in LanguageHaveWorkedWith.

Therefore, no respondents meet both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have CompTotal of 1130.0 and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing SQL?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- CompTotal is an open-ended field representing total compensation, here specifically looking for the value ""1130.0"".
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages worked with, separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose CompTotal equals ""1130.0"" and whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""SQL"".
- From the responses, only respondent 379 has CompTotal of 1130.0.
- Respondent 379's LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Go;JavaScript;PHP;Rust;SQL"", which contains ""SQL"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have MainBranch A and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing Swift?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- MainBranch is a multiple-choice question with options including ""A. I am a developer by profession"".
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with.
- We need to find respondents whose MainBranch is ""I am a developer by profession"" and whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Swift"".
- From the responses, MainBranch values are given as codes or text; we must map ""A"" to ""I am a developer by profession"".
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith values are semicolon-separated lists of languages.

Checking the respondents:

- Respondent 383: MainBranch ""A"" → ""I am a developer by profession""; LanguageHaveWorkedWith does not include Swift.
- Respondent 73037: MainBranch ""A"" → ""I am a developer by profession""; LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""C++;Ruby;Swift"" → contains Swift.
- Respondent 73144: MainBranch ""A"" → ""I am a developer by profession""; LanguageHaveWorkedWith does not include Swift.
- Respondent 389: MainBranch ""A"" → ""I am a developer by profession""; LanguageHaveWorkedWith does not include Swift.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have MainBranch A and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing PowerShell?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- MainBranch is a multiple-choice question with options including ""A. I am a developer by profession"".
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages and technologies the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose MainBranch is ""I am a developer by profession"" and whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""PowerShell"".
- From the responses, MainBranch ""A"" corresponds to ""I am a developer by profession"".
- We must check each respondent's LanguageHaveWorkedWith for the presence of ""PowerShell"".

Checking respondents:

- Respondent 288: MainBranch is ""A"" (I am a developer by profession), LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Bash/Shell;HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Kotlin;SQL;TypeScript"" — no PowerShell.
- Respondent 72915: MainBranch is ""A"", LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Dart;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;TypeScript"" — no PowerShell.
- Respondent 72805: MainBranch is ""A"", LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Bash/Shell;C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PHP;PowerShell;SQL;TypeScript"" — includes PowerShell.
- Respondent 73018: MainBranch is ""A"", LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Java;SQL"" — no PowerShell.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have YearsCode of 22 and EdLevel E?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- YearsCode is an open-ended field representing total years of coding experience.
- EdLevel is a multiple-choice question with options including E: Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.).
- We need to find respondents with YearsCode exactly 22 and EdLevel exactly ""Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.)"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have MainBranch A and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing SQL?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- MainBranch is a multiple-choice question with options including ""A. I am a developer by profession"".
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose MainBranch answer is ""I am a developer by profession"" and whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""SQL"".
- From the responses, the relevant respondents are those with MainBranch ""A"" and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing the substring ""SQL"".
- Checking each respondent for these criteria will identify the matching respondent IDs.

Matching respondents:

- Respondent 511: MainBranch ""A"" and LanguageHaveWorkedWith ""C#;F#;SQL"" → contains SQL
- Respondent 106: MainBranch ""A"" and LanguageHaveWorkedWith ""Go;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;SQL;TypeScript"" → contains SQL
- Respondent 306: MainBranch ""A"" and LanguageHaveWorkedWith ""C#;HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Python;SQL"" → contains SQL
- Respondent 29043: MainBranch ""A"" and LanguageHaveWorkedWith ""C#"" → does not contain SQL

Final answer:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have VersionControlSystem A and DevType containing Developer, desktop or enterprise applications?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- VersionControlSystem is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Git, B. Mercurial, C. SVN, D. I don't use one. We are looking for respondents with VersionControlSystem ""Git"".
- DevType is an open-ended field listing roles in development. We need to find respondents whose DevType contains the substring ""Developer, desktop or enterprise applications"".
- The respondents section contains four respondents with their respective answers.
- Among these, we must check each respondent's VersionControlSystem answer and DevType answer to see if they meet both criteria.
- Only respondents with VersionControlSystem ""Git"" and DevType containing ""Developer, desktop or enterprise applications"" qualify.

Checking respondents:

- Respondent 29048: VersionControlSystem = A (Git), DevType = ""Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;Developer, embedded applications or devices"" → matches both criteria.
- Respondent 73076: VersionControlSystem = A (Git), DevType = ""Developer, full-stack;Educator"" → does not contain ""Developer, desktop or enterprise applications"".
- Respondent 73047: VersionControlSystem = A (Git), DevType = ""Developer, back-end;Cloud infrastructure engineer"" → does not contain ""Developer, desktop or enterprise applications"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing Ruby and VersionControlSystem A?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- VersionControlSystem is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Git, B. Mercurial, C. SVN, D. I don't use one.
- We need to find respondents whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Ruby"" exactly and whose VersionControlSystem answer is ""Git"" (mapped from A).
- Among the respondents, only respondent 448 has ""Ruby"" in LanguageHaveWorkedWith.
- Respondent 448's VersionControlSystem answer is ""A"", which maps to ""Git"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have MainBranch A and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing HTML/CSS?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- MainBranch is a multiple-choice question with options including ""A. I am a developer by profession"".
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages worked with, separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose MainBranch is ""I am a developer by profession"" and whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""HTML/CSS"".
- From the responses, MainBranch ""A"" corresponds to ""I am a developer by profession"".
- Checking each respondent's LanguageHaveWorkedWith for the substring ""HTML/CSS"" will identify matches.

Respondents with MainBranch ""I am a developer by profession"" and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing ""HTML/CSS"" are: 206, 72824.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have DevType containing Developer, full-stack and VersionControlSystem A?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- DevType is an open-ended field describing roles in development; we need to find respondents whose DevType includes ""Developer, full-stack"".
- VersionControlSystem is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Git, B. Mercurial, C. SVN, D. I don't use one. We need respondents with VersionControlSystem ""Git"".
- Respondents have various DevType values, some including multiple roles separated by semicolons.
- We must match both conditions simultaneously: DevType containing ""Developer, full-stack"" and VersionControlSystem equal to ""Git"".
- From the responses, we will check each respondent's DevType and VersionControlSystem accordingly.

Checking respondents:

- Respondent 73107: DevType includes ""Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack"" and VersionControlSystem is A (Git) → matches.
- Respondent 72835: DevType includes ""Developer, front-end;Engineer, site reliability;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, QA or test;Designer;System administrator"" and VersionControlSystem is A (Git) → matches.
- Respondent 57: DevType is ""Developer, back-end;Developer, embedded applications or devices"" and VersionControlSystem is A (Git) → does not include ""Developer, full-stack"".

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Country India and CompTotal of 500000.0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- The ""Country"" field is open-ended and represents the country of residence of the respondent.  
- The ""CompTotal"" field is open-ended and represents the total compensation of the respondent as a numeric value.  
- We need to find respondents whose ""Country"" is exactly ""India"" and whose ""CompTotal"" is exactly ""500000.0"".  
- Among the respondents, only one has ""Country"" as ""India"" and ""CompTotal"" as ""500000.0"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have DevType containing Developer, full-stack and CompTotal of 950000.0?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question are as follows:  
- DevType is an open-ended field describing roles in development, such as ""Developer, full-stack"".  
- CompTotal is an open-ended field representing total compensation, given as a numeric value (e.g., 950000.0).  
- We need to find respondents whose DevType includes the exact phrase ""Developer, full-stack"" and whose CompTotal equals 950000.0.  
- The dataset contains three respondents with their DevType and CompTotal values clearly listed.  
- Only one respondent has DevType containing ""Developer, full-stack"" and CompTotal exactly 950000.0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have CompFreq C and LanguageWantToWorkWith containing TypeScript?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- CompFreq is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Weekly, B. Monthly, C. Yearly. We are interested in respondents with CompFreq = C (Yearly).
- LanguageWantToWorkWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages respondents want to use, separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose LanguageWantToWorkWith includes ""TypeScript"" exactly as spelled.
- The respondents section contains four respondents with IDs 72634, 412, 72751, and 73129.
- Among these, we must check which have CompFreq = C and LanguageWantToWorkWith containing ""TypeScript"".

Checking each respondent:

- 72634: CompFreq = C (Yearly), LanguageWantToWorkWith = ""Elixir;LISP;Python"" (no TypeScript)
- 412: CompFreq = B (Monthly), LanguageWantToWorkWith includes no TypeScript
- 72751: CompFreq = C (Yearly), LanguageWantToWorkWith = ""C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Rust;TypeScript"" (includes TypeScript)
- 73129: CompFreq = B (Monthly), LanguageWantToWorkWith = ""HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;PHP;Python;SQL"" (no TypeScript)

Only respondent 72751 meets both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have CompFreq C and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing Bash/Shell?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- CompFreq is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Weekly, B. Monthly, C. Yearly. We are interested in respondents with CompFreq = C, meaning ""Yearly"".
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Bash/Shell"" exactly as spelled.
- The respondents section contains three respondents with IDs 72659, 245, and 29098.
- We will check each respondent's CompFreq and LanguageHaveWorkedWith fields to find those matching CompFreq = ""Yearly"" and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing ""Bash/Shell"".

Checking respondents:

- Respondent 72659: CompFreq = C (""Yearly""), LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""Bash/Shell"" → matches.
- Respondent 245: CompFreq = C (""Yearly""), LanguageHaveWorkedWith does not include ""Bash/Shell"" → no.
- Respondent 29098: CompFreq = B (""Monthly""), LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""C;C++;Dart;Go;Java;JavaScript;Solidity;SQL;TypeScript"" but no ""Bash/Shell"" → no.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- DevType is an open-ended field describing roles in development; we look for ""Developer, front-end"" as a substring.  
- CompTotal is an open-ended field representing total compensation; we look for the exact value 128000.0.  
- Among respondents, only respondent 72682 has DevType containing ""Developer, front-end"" and CompTotal exactly 128000.0.  
- Other respondents either do not have ""Developer, front-end"" in DevType or have different CompTotal values.  
- The question requires exact matches for both conditions simultaneously.

Which respondent numbers have LanguageWantToWorkWith containing Java and VersionControlSystem A?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- LanguageWantToWorkWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent wants to use.
- VersionControlSystem is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Git, B. Mercurial, C. SVN, D. I don't use one.
- We need to find respondents whose LanguageWantToWorkWith includes ""Java"" exactly as a substring (case-sensitive as per data).
- We also need respondents whose VersionControlSystem answer is ""A"", which maps to ""Git"".
- There are three respondents in the data: 213, 72752, and 72686.
- We will check each respondent's LanguageWantToWorkWith and VersionControlSystem answers accordingly.

Checking respondents:

- Respondent 213: LanguageWantToWorkWith includes ""Java"" among many languages; VersionControlSystem is ""A"" → Git.
- Respondent 72752: LanguageWantToWorkWith is ""C#;TypeScript"" (no Java); VersionControlSystem is ""A"".
- Respondent 72686: LanguageWantToWorkWith is ""Clojure;Dart;Go;Kotlin;Rust;Scala"" (no Java); VersionControlSystem is ""A"".

Only respondent 213 meets both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing HTML/CSS and LanguageWantToWorkWith containing Rust?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- LanguageWantToWorkWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent wants to use, also separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""HTML/CSS"" exactly and whose LanguageWantToWorkWith includes ""Rust"" exactly.
- From the responses, the relevant respondents are those with these exact substrings in their respective fields.
- Checking each respondent:  
  - Respondent 242 has LanguageHaveWorkedWith: ""HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PHP;Python;SQL"" (includes HTML/CSS) and LanguageWantToWorkWith: ""C++;Python;Rust"" (includes Rust).  
  - Respondent 413 has LanguageHaveWorkedWith: ""HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Rust;SQL"" (includes HTML/CSS) and LanguageWantToWorkWith: ""Rust"" (includes Rust).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have MainBranch A and DevType containing Cloud infrastructure engineer?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- MainBranch is a multiple-choice question with options including ""A. I am a developer by profession"".
- DevType is an open-ended field listing roles in development, such as ""Developer, front-end"", ""Developer, full-stack"", ""Cloud infrastructure engineer"", etc.
- We need to find respondents whose MainBranch is ""I am a developer by profession"" and whose DevType includes the phrase ""Cloud infrastructure engineer"".
- From the responses, only respondent 386 has MainBranch ""A"" (which maps to ""I am a developer by profession"") and DevType containing ""Cloud infrastructure engineer"".
- Other respondents either do not have MainBranch ""A"" or do not have ""Cloud infrastructure engineer"" in their DevType.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have YearsCodePro of 5 and LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing TypeScript?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- YearsCodePro is an open-ended field representing years of professional coding experience. We are looking specifically for respondents with a value of 5.
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages worked with, separated by semicolons. We need to find respondents whose list includes ""TypeScript"".
- Respondent IDs are given in the ResponseId field.
- From the responses, YearsCodePro values range from 1 to 5 in the given data.
- LanguageHaveWorkedWith values include multiple languages separated by semicolons, and TypeScript appears in some respondents' lists.

Checking the respondents:

- Respondent 73143: YearsCodePro = 4 (no)
- Respondent 72759: YearsCodePro = 1 (no)
- Respondent 409: YearsCodePro = 5 and LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""TypeScript"" (yes)
- Respondent 61: YearsCodePro = 4 (no)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have LanguageHaveWorkedWith containing SQL and LanguageWantToWorkWith containing Ruby?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- LanguageHaveWorkedWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent has worked with, separated by semicolons.
- LanguageWantToWorkWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent wants to work with, also separated by semicolons.
- We need to find respondents whose LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes ""SQL"" and whose LanguageWantToWorkWith includes ""Ruby"".
- From the responses, the relevant respondents are 72984, 72720, and 29045.
- Checking these, only respondent 29045 has both ""SQL"" in LanguageHaveWorkedWith and ""Ruby"" in LanguageWantToWorkWith.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have LanguageWantToWorkWith containing Erlang and CompFreq B?
</task>","Critical values and ranges related to the question:

- LanguageWantToWorkWith is an open-ended field listing programming languages the respondent wants to use.
- CompFreq is a multiple-choice question with options: A. Weekly, B. Monthly, C. Yearly.
- We need to find respondents whose LanguageWantToWorkWith includes ""Erlang"" exactly as spelled and whose CompFreq is ""B"" (Monthly).
- From the responses, the relevant respondents are those with ""Erlang"" in LanguageWantToWorkWith and CompFreq value ""B"".
- Checking each respondent for these criteria will identify the matching respondent IDs.

Final answer: 72720",True
