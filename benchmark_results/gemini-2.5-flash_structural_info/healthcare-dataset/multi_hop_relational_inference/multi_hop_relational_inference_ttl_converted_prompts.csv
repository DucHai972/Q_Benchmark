</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Gender Female and Blood Type O+?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from individuals, detailing various personal and medical attributes. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a number, and their information is structured using predefined predicates like Name, Age, Gender, and Medical Condition. The data includes both open-ended text fields and multiple-choice questions, with letter codes for MCQ responses mapped to specific text options in the schema. This allows for a clear and consistent interpretation of each respondent's profile.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>

</task>","The dataset describes individual respondents with various attributes like name, age, gender, medical condition, and hospital-related information. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a number (e.g., Respondent35). Key attributes like Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, Insurance Provider, Admission Type, Medication, and Test Results are multiple-choice questions (MCQ) with letter codes mapping to specific text values, while others like Name, Age, and Billing Amount are open-ended. The data allows for filtering and querying based on these specific attributes and their corresponding values.

Which respondent numbers have Blood Type B- and Medical Condition Asthma?
</task>","The dataset describes medical survey responses, with each respondent having attributes like name, age, gender, blood type, medical condition, and various hospital-related details. The data is structured using RDF-like triples, where predicates link respondents to their specific answers, often using single-letter codes for multiple-choice questions. There are three distinct respondent entries provided, each with a comprehensive set of medical and administrative information. The 'Questions' section serves as a crucial schema, mapping these letter codes to their human-readable values for accurate interpretation.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Test Results Abnormal and Admission Type Urgent?
</task>","The dataset describes various attributes for different respondents, including personal details, medical information, and hospital visit specifics. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a number, and their data is structured using predicates like `pred:Name`, `pred:Age`, `pred:Gender`, and `pred:Medical_Condition`. Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are represented by single-letter codes in the responses, which map to descriptive text in the questions schema. The data allows for filtering and querying based on specific attribute values, such as medical conditions or admission types.

Which respondent numbers have Blood Type B- and Test Results Normal?
</task>","Structural Information, Patterns, and Statistics:
The dataset describes individual respondents with various medical and personal attributes. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a number (e.g., Respondent60). The data includes both open-ended fields like Name and Age, and multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for categories such as Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, and Test Results, where responses are coded with letters. There are 15 distinct attributes recorded for each person, covering demographic, medical, and administrative details related to hospital visits. The data appears to be a collection of individual patient records, with consistent predicates used across all respondents.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Medical Condition Cancer and Medication Penicillin?
</task>","The dataset describes individual survey responses, each identified by a unique respondent number (e.g., :Respondent5). Each respondent has various attributes such as Name, Age, Gender, Medical Condition, and Medication, among others. Many attributes are multiple-choice questions (MCQ) with letter codes mapping to specific text values, while others are open-ended. The data is structured in RDF-like triples, linking respondents to their answers via predicates like `pred:Medical_Condition` and `pred:Medication`.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Blood Type B- and Admission Type Urgent?
</task>","The dataset describes various attributes of survey respondents, including demographic information, medical conditions, and hospital visit details. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a number, and their responses are structured using predefined predicates. The 'questions' section serves as a legend, mapping short codes (e.g., 'a', 'b') to their full descriptive values for multiple-choice questions. This allows for a clear interpretation of the raw response data.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Medical Condition Hypertension and Admission Type Elective?
</task>","The dataset is structured with a clear distinction between question definitions and individual respondent data, using RDF-like triples. Questions are defined with `pred:text` and, for multiple-choice questions, include letter-coded options. Each respondent is an instance of `:Person` with various `pred:` properties corresponding to the questions, storing either open-ended text/numerical values or single-letter codes for MCQ answers. This structure allows for precise querying of specific attributes across respondents. Not all respondents have values for every predicate, indicating potential missing data points for some fields.

<task>
Which respondent numbers have Gender Male and Test Results Normal?
</task>","The dataset describes individual respondents, each identified by a unique number and characterized by 15 distinct attributes, ranging from personal details like `pred:Name` and `pred:Age` to medical information such as `pred:Medical_Condition` and `pred:Test_Results`. Many attributes are structured as multiple-choice questions, where letter codes in the responses map to specific text options defined in the schema, ensuring standardized data entry for categories like `pred:Gender` and `pred:Admission_Type`. Conversely, fields like `pred:Date_of_Admission` and `pred:Billing_Amount` are open-ended, accommodating a variety of free-form text or numerical inputs. The data consistently uses the `pred:` prefix for all properties, indicating a uniform predicate structure across all respondent entries. This consistent structure facilitates querying and analysis of specific respondent characteristics and their combinations.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>

</task>","The dataset describes various attributes for each respondent, including personal details, medical information, and hospital-related data. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a number, and their responses are structured using predicates like `pred:Name`, `pred:Age`, `pred:Gender`, and `pred:Medical_Condition`. Many fields are multiple-choice questions (MCQ) with letter codes mapping to specific text values, while others are open-ended. The data allows for filtering and querying based on specific attribute values, such as blood type and insurance provider.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent numbers have Blood Type O+ and Medication Ibuprofen?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from individuals, detailing various medical and personal attributes. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a number and has structured data points for fields like Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, and more, with some fields being multiple-choice questions (MCQ) and others open-ended. The MCQ options are represented by single letters, which map to specific human-readable values defined in the questions section. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of specific demographic and health-related information for each person.
