<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 17?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two primary sections: `questions`, which serves as a schema defining each survey item, and `responses`, containing the actual data from individual participants. The `questions` section outlines ten distinct fields, including open-ended text inputs for ""Date"" and ""SessionName"", and rubric-based numerical ratings for performance metrics like ""Identification"" and ""Assessment"". Each rubric-based question uses a scale from 0 to 3, indicating a progression from poor to comprehensive performance. The `responses` section lists three unique respondents (17, 19, 14), each providing answers across all defined questions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 2?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session evaluations from different respondents, with each response detailing various aspects like session name, date, and performance metrics. The `questions` section defines 10 fields, including open-ended text fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and rubric-based numerical scores for skills such as 'Identification' and 'Situation'. The `responses` section lists individual evaluations, identified by a 'respondent' ID, and their corresponding 'answers' to these questions. Numerical scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence as per the rubrics.

What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The dataset is structured with a `questions` section defining the schema for various assessment criteria, including open-ended and rubric-based questions. The `responses` section contains individual respondent data, each identified by a unique `respondent` ID and an `answers` object. Most answers are numerical scores based on a 0-3 rubric, while fields like ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" are open-ended text. A common pattern observed is that ""Identification"" scores are consistently high (3) across the provided respondents. The ""Comments"" field often contains additional notes, such as session timings or qualitative feedback.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 5?
</task>","Structural Information: The dataset consists of two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the schema for various assessment criteria, including open-ended text fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and rubric-based numerical scores for aspects like 'Identification', 'Situation', and 'Background'. The `responses` section contains individual respondent data, each identified by a 'respondent' ID, with their 'answers' corresponding to the defined questions.

Patterns and Statistics: Each respondent provides answers across all defined questions. The rubric-based questions have scores ranging from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. For instance, 'Identification' scores vary, with respondent 2 scoring 3 (complete information) and respondent 5 scoring 0 (requires direct prompting). 'Comments' are open-ended, often including time stamps or qualitative feedback.

</task>","The dataset is structured into two main sections: `questions` which defines the schema and rubrics for various assessment criteria, and `responses` which contains the actual data from multiple respondents. Each respondent's entry includes a unique ID and an `answers` object detailing their scores or text inputs for each question. The questions are a mix of open-ended text fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and rubric-based qualitative assessments scored from 0 to 3. The rubric scores consistently reflect the defined confidence levels or completeness of information. The 'Comments' field allows for free-form textual feedback, providing additional qualitative insights.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the session name for respondent 3?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session evaluations, with a `questions` schema defining the fields and a `responses` array holding individual respondent data. Each response includes a unique `respondent` ID and an `answers` object containing various session details and rubric scores. The `SessionName` field is open-ended, providing a specific name for each session. Other fields like `Identification` and `Situation` are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 5?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two primary JSON objects: `questions`, which serves as a schema defining the survey fields and their rubrics, and `responses`, containing individual respondent data. The `questions` section outlines ten distinct fields, including open-ended text inputs for ""Date"" and ""SessionName,"" and rubric-based scoring for clinical competencies like ""Identification"" and ""Assessment,"" typically ranging from 0 to 3. Each entry in the `responses` array represents a unique respondent, identified by a numerical ID, and includes their specific answers for all the defined questions. The data captures both qualitative comments and quantitative performance ratings, offering a detailed evaluation of each session. A notable pattern is the consistent application of a 0-3 rubric for most skill-based questions, with an occasional -1 score observed for ""Identification,"" suggesting a possible 'not applicable' or 'not observed' category.

The `questions` section serves as a schema, detailing each assessment category, its description, and for rubric-based questions, the meaning of each score (0-3). The `responses` section contains an array of individual respondent data, each identified by a `respondent` ID and containing their `answers` to the questions. Most answers are numerical ratings based on a rubric, while fields like `Date`, `SessionName`, and `Comments` are open-ended text.

<task>
What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 10?
</task>","The dataset is structured with a `questions` section defining the schema for various assessment criteria, including open-ended and rubric-based questions. The `responses` section contains individual respondent data, each identified by a unique `respondent` ID and an `answers` object. Most assessment criteria, such as `Identification` and `Assessment`, are evaluated using a 0-3 rubric scale, indicating different levels of performance. Fields like `Date` and `SessionName` capture specific textual information, while `Comments` allow for qualitative feedback. The provided responses show a range of scores across different categories, reflecting varied performance levels among the respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main sections: `questions` defining the survey schema, and `responses` containing individual respondent data. The `questions` section outlines 10 different assessment criteria, some being open-ended text fields and others rubric-based with numerical scores. The `responses` section is an array of objects, each representing a respondent with a unique ID and their answers to the defined questions. Numerical scores for rubric-based questions range from 0 to 3, with one instance of -1 for ""Identification"". This clear structure facilitates direct lookup of specific answers for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 15?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section serves as a schema, detailing each assessment criterion, its type (open-ended or rubric-based), and the meaning of its scores. The `responses` section contains individual records, each identified by a `respondent` ID, and their corresponding `answers` to the questions. Most answers are numerical ratings from 0 to 3, reflecting performance levels, while fields like ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" are free-text entries. This structure allows for a clear and consistent evaluation of different session aspects across multiple respondents.

What is the identification score for respondent 16?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main parts: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section serves as a schema, detailing various assessment criteria, including open-ended text fields and rubric-based numerical scores for specific skills. The `responses` section contains individual entries for each `respondent`, identified by a unique ID, with their `answers` provided for each question. Numerical scores are used for rubric-based questions, while text is used for open-ended questions like ""Date"" and ""SessionName"". This structure allows for a standardized evaluation of different aspects of a session across multiple respondents.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The dataset consists of a `questions` schema defining various assessment criteria and a `responses` array containing individual respondent data. Questions are categorized into open-ended text fields like ""Date"" and ""Comments,"" and rubric-based numerical ratings for skills such as ""Identification"" and ""Assessment."" Most rubric questions use a consistent 0-3 scale, where 3 signifies the highest level of performance or completeness. Each respondent's entry includes their unique ID and a dictionary of their answers corresponding to the defined questions. The data allows for tracking specific performance metrics for each respondent across different aspects of a session.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the date for respondent 14?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session evaluations, with a `questions` schema defining the fields and a `responses` array holding individual respondent data. Each respondent entry includes a unique `respondent` ID and an `answers` object detailing various aspects of a session, such as `Date`, `SessionName`, and several rubric-scored performance metrics like `Identification` and `Situation`. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence, while `Date`, `SessionName`, and `Comments` are open-ended text fields. The data shows consistent structure across respondents, allowing for direct lookup of specific session details.

What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session evaluations, including open-ended questions like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-based ratings for various aspects of a medical session such as 'Identification', 'Situation', and 'Assessment'. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a number, and their answers are nested under their respective respondent ID. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of completeness or confidence. The data structure is consistent across all respondents, allowing for direct lookup of specific answers based on respondent ID and question name.

What is the global rating score for respondent 10?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main sections: `questions`, which serves as a schema defining each field and its rubric, and `responses`, which contains the actual data from individual respondents. Each respondent entry includes a unique identifier and an `answers` object detailing their responses across various session aspects. Most fields are scored on a 0-3 rubric, indicating different levels of performance or confidence, while ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" are open-ended text fields. The provided responses include data for three distinct respondents (10, 14, 22), each with unique session details. A common pattern observed is that all respondents in this sample scored relatively high (2 or 3) across most rubric-based questions.

What is the global rating score for respondent 3?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section serves as a schema, detailing each assessment criterion, its type (open-ended or rubric-based), and the meaning of its scores. The `responses` section contains individual entries for each `respondent`, identified by a unique ID, and their `answers` to all the questions. Numerical answers for rubric-based questions range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence, while other fields capture specific dates, session names, or comments. This setup facilitates a comprehensive and standardized evaluation of various sessions.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 9?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section serves as a schema, detailing each assessment criterion, its type (open-ended or rubric-based), and the meaning of the rubric scores. The `responses` section contains individual respondent data, with each respondent identified by a unique number and providing answers to all defined questions. Numerical scores for rubric-based questions consistently fall within a 0-3 range, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence. This structure allows for a clear and standardized evaluation of different aspects of medical sessions across multiple respondents.
