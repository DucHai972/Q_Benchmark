<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 17?
</task>","The document is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" which serves as a schema defining the survey fields and their types (open-ended or rubric-based), and ""Responses"" which contains the actual data from individual respondents. Each respondent's data is presented as a list of key-value pairs, corresponding to the fields defined in the ""Questions"" section. The data includes a mix of dates, session names, numerical scores based on rubrics, and open-ended comments. There are three respondents in this dataset, each providing a complete set of responses for all ten questions.

<task>
What is the date for respondent 13?
</task>","The data is structured as an HTML document containing two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section acts as a schema, defining various survey fields such as 'Date', 'SessionName', and several rubric-based assessment criteria like 'Identification' and 'Situation'. The ""Responses"" section contains individual respondent data, each identified by a ""Respondent"" heading followed by a list of their answers corresponding to the fields defined in the ""Questions"" section. Each response item consists of a strong-tagged field name and its associated value. The data appears to be a collection of survey results from multiple respondents, detailing session information and performance ratings.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 2?
</task>","The data consists of a 'Questions' section defining survey fields and a 'Responses' section containing data from multiple respondents. Each respondent's data is structured as a list of key-value pairs, corresponding to the fields defined in the 'Questions' section. Fields include open-ended text (like Date, SessionName, Comments) and rubric-based scores (like Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. The dataset allows for tracking specific metrics and comments for individual respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured as an HTML document containing two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section defines the fields collected, including their types (open-ended or rubric-based) and the meaning of rubric scores. The ""Responses"" section lists individual respondents, each with a unique ID, and their answers for each defined field. Each respondent's data is presented as an unordered list of key-value pairs. The data primarily consists of dates, session names, and numerical scores for various assessment criteria, along with open-ended comments.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 5?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section defines the fields and their possible values, including open-ended text fields and rubric-based scores from 0 to 3, with one instance of -1. The ""Responses"" section contains individual respondent data, each identified by a unique number, listing their answers for each defined field. Each respondent's data is presented as an unordered list of key-value pairs.

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: 'Questions' and 'Responses'. The 'Questions' section acts as a schema, defining various survey fields such as 'Date', 'SessionName', 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', 'Recommendation (global rating scale)', and 'Comments'. Each field specifies whether it's open-ended or uses a rubric with numerical scores. The 'Responses' section contains individual entries for different respondents, each listing their answers for the defined fields. The numerical scores for rubric-based questions range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 1?
</task>","The dataset presents survey responses from three distinct respondents, each identified by a unique number. Each respondent's entry consistently includes ten fields, covering session details like Date and SessionName, and performance metrics such as Identification, Situation, and various Background, Assessment, and Recommendation scores. Most performance-related fields are evaluated using a rubric scale, typically from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of proficiency or confidence. Open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments capture specific textual information. The data is structured hierarchically, with respondent headings followed by an unordered list of their respective field responses.

<task>
What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 10?
</task>","The data is structured as an HTML document containing two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section acts as a schema, defining various survey fields such as 'Date', 'SessionName', 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', 'Recommendation (global rating scale)', and 'Comments'. Each question specifies whether it's open-ended or uses a rubric with numerical scores and their corresponding descriptions. The ""Responses"" section contains individual respondent data, with each respondent identified by a number (e.g., Respondent 10, Respondent 9, Respondent 2) and their answers listed under the respective field names.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The data contains responses from three respondents (19, 6, and 23), each providing details on a session including date, session name, and various performance metrics. Most metrics are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of completeness or accuracy, while 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' are open-ended. Respondent 6 has an outlier score of -1 for 'Identification', suggesting a possible data entry error or a unique scoring convention not detailed in the rubric. All respondents provided comments, which are open-ended text fields.

</task>","The data is structured as an HTML document with two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section acts as a schema, defining each survey field, its type (open-ended or rubric-based), and the meaning of its scores. The ""Responses"" section contains individual respondent data, organized under ""Respondent"" headings, with each respondent's answers listed as key-value pairs corresponding to the questions. Most fields use a 0-3 rubric for scoring, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence, while others capture specific dates, session names, or free-form comments.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The data is structured as an HTML document containing two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section defines the fields and their respective rubrics or types (open-ended, rubric-based). The ""Responses"" section contains individual respondent data, each identified by a unique number, with values provided for each field defined in the ""Questions"" section. All rubric-based fields use numerical scores (0-3), while ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" are open-ended text fields.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section defines the fields collected, including open-ended text fields like ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"", and rubric-based fields for various medical assessment criteria such as ""Identification"", ""Situation"", and ""Assessment"". Each rubric-based field provides a scale from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. The ""Responses"" section contains individual entries for each respondent, identified by a unique number, listing their specific answers for each defined field.

<task>
What is the date for respondent 9?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" which defines the fields and their possible values (including rubrics for scored items and open-ended fields), and ""Responses"" which contains the actual data for each respondent. Each respondent's data is presented as an unordered list of key-value pairs, where the key is the field name and the value is the respondent's input. The ""Responses"" section shows data for three respondents: 9, 16, and 6, each with consistent fields like Date, SessionName, and various rubric-scored assessments.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the date for respondent 3?
</task>","The data consists of a 'Questions' section defining the survey fields and a 'Responses' section containing data from three respondents (3, 2, and 12). Each respondent's data is structured as a list of key-value pairs, covering fields like Date, SessionName, and various rubric-scored assessments (Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). Most fields are open-ended or use a 0-3 rubric scale, with one instance of a -1 score for 'Background (examination)' for Respondent 12. The 'Comments' field is open-ended, often including time stamps or additional observations.

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 23?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section acts as a schema, defining each data field, its type (open-ended or rubric-based), and the meaning of its values. The ""Responses"" section contains individual survey submissions, each identified by a ""Respondent"" number, followed by a list of their answers corresponding to the fields defined in the ""Questions"" section. Each response item consists of a strong-tagged field name and its associated value. The data allows for tracking specific metrics like 'Identification' and 'SessionName' for each respondent.

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 14?
</task>","The data is structured as an HTML document, clearly separating the survey questions (schema) from the individual respondent answers. Each respondent's data is presented as a list of key-value pairs, corresponding to the questions asked. Most questions utilize a numerical rubric scale from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence, while 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' are open-ended text fields. A notable pattern is the consistent use of numerical scores for rubric-based questions, though one instance shows an out-of-range value (-1) for 'Background (examination)' for Respondent 12.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 18?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section acts as a schema, defining various survey fields such as 'Date', 'SessionName', and several rubric-based assessments like 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)', along with their possible values or rubrics. The ""Responses"" section contains individual entries for different respondents, each listing their specific answers for the defined fields. Each respondent's data is presented as an unordered list of key-value pairs.

<task>
What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The provided data is structured as an HTML document containing two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section acts as a schema, defining various survey fields such as 'Date', 'SessionName', 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', 'Recommendation (global rating scale)', and 'Comments'. Each field specifies its type (open-ended or rubric-based with score meanings). The ""Responses"" section contains individual survey submissions, each identified by a ""Respondent"" number, followed by a list of their answers corresponding to the fields defined in the ""Questions"" section. The data appears to be a collection of evaluations or session records, with some fields being free text and others numerical ratings based on a rubric.

What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section acts as a schema, defining various survey fields such as 'Date', 'SessionName', 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', 'Recommendation (global rating scale)', and 'Comments'. Each field specifies its type, whether open-ended or a rubric-based rating. The ""Responses"" section contains individual respondent data, with each respondent having a unique ID (e.g., Respondent 4, Respondent 5, Respondent 2) and a list of their answers corresponding to the fields defined in the ""Questions"" section. The rubric-based fields use numerical scores from 0 to 3, while open-ended fields contain specific text values.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 14?
</task>","The document is structured as an HTML page with two main sections: ""Questions"" defining the survey fields and ""Responses"" containing individual respondent data. Each question has a strong tag for its name and a description, with some fields being open-ended and others using a 0-3 rubric scale. The responses are organized by respondent ID, with each respondent's answers listed as key-value pairs. All respondents provide data for every field. The data types include dates, open-ended text for session names and comments, and numerical scores for rubric-based assessments.

- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the date for respondent 16?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" which defines the fields and their types (open-ended or rubric-based), and ""Responses"" which contains the actual data for each respondent. Each respondent's data is presented as an unordered list of key-value pairs, where the key is the field name (e.g., Date, SessionName) and the value is the recorded response. The ""Responses"" section currently includes data for three respondents: 16, 17, and 20. Fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName' are open-ended, while others like 'Identification' and 'Situation' use a numerical rubric scale from 0 to 3.
