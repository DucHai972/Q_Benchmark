<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 17?
</task>","The provided data consists of survey responses from three respondents (17, 19, 14) across ten distinct questions, including open-ended text fields and rubric-scored items. Each respondent has a complete set of answers for Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), Recommendation (global rating scale), and Comments. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence. Dates are consistent within the same day for some respondents, and session names vary, with ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" appearing twice.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The provided data consists of survey responses from multiple respondents, each detailing various aspects of a session. Each respondent has a unique ID and provides values for ten distinct questions, including open-ended text fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-based scores for 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. All respondents in this sample have complete data entries across all fields.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the date for respondent 15?
</task>","The dataset contains survey responses from multiple respondents, each identified by a unique number. For each respondent, there are ten data points, including open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-scored fields for 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of completeness or confidence. The data is structured consistently across all respondents, allowing for direct lookup of specific fields for a given respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 1?
</task>","The dataset contains survey responses from multiple respondents, each providing data across ten distinct questions. These questions cover various aspects of a session, including open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-based scores for 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence, with a notable exception of -1 for 'Identification' in one instance. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a numerical ID, and their responses are structured consistently under these predefined fields.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The provided data consists of survey responses from multiple respondents, each detailing their performance across various criteria related to a session. The 'Questions' section defines 10 fields, including open-ended text fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and rubric-based scoring fields such as 'Identification' and 'Situation'. Most rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of completeness or proficiency. The 'Responses' section lists individual respondent data, with each respondent having a unique ID and values for all defined fields.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The survey data is structured with a set of 10 questions, each having a specific type (open-ended or rubric-based). The responses section provides individual data points for each respondent, identified by a unique number. Most rubric-based questions use a 0-3 scale, with higher numbers generally indicating better performance or confidence, though one question (Identification) has a -1 value for Respondent 6.

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: 'Questions' defining the survey fields and their rubrics, and 'Responses' containing individual respondent data. Each respondent is uniquely identified and provides answers across 10 distinct fields, including open-ended text and rubric-based scores. The rubric scores, typically ranging from 0 to 3, quantify performance or confidence levels for various aspects of the session. A notable pattern is the consistent use of specific rubrics for performance-related questions, although one instance shows a score outside the defined range. The 'Comments' field offers qualitative insights, complementing the quantitative scores.

What is the session name for respondent 18?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from multiple respondents, each identified by a number. For each respondent, there are ten data points, including open-ended text fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-scored fields such as 'Identification', 'Situation', and 'Assessment'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence, with higher scores generally representing better outcomes. Some fields, like 'Background (examination)' for Respondent 12, show non-standard values (-1), suggesting potential data entry anomalies or specific coding for missing/not applicable data. Overall, the structure is consistent across respondents, allowing for direct lookup of specific attributes.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 2?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: 'Questions' defining the survey fields and their rubrics, and 'Responses' containing individual respondent data. Each respondent is uniquely identified and provides answers across 10 distinct fields, including open-ended text, dates, and rubric-based scores. The rubric scores, typically ranging from 0 to 3, quantify performance or confidence levels for various aspects of the session. Some fields, like 'Date' and 'SessionName', capture specific session details, while 'Comments' offers qualitative feedback.

For each respondent, there are ten data points, including open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-based scores for 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The data presents survey responses from three distinct respondents (19, 13, 22), each providing answers to ten predefined questions. These questions cover a mix of open-ended fields such as 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-scored evaluations for various skills like 'Identification', 'Situation', and 'Assessment'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, with higher numbers generally indicating better performance or greater confidence. A common pattern observed is that most respondents scored highly (2s or 3s) across the rubric-based questions, suggesting a generally positive assessment of the sessions.

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main sections: `Questions`, which serves as a schema defining 10 survey items, and `Responses`, containing individual respondent data. Each respondent's entry consistently includes values for all defined questions, encompassing open-ended text fields like 'Date' and 'Comments', and rubric-scored fields such as 'Identification' and 'Situation'. The rubric scores, ranging from 0 to 3, quantify performance levels, with 3 indicating the highest achievement. A noticeable pattern in the 'SessionName' field involves Roman numerals paired with medical conditions. Across the provided respondents, there's a general trend of high scores (2 or 3) in the rubric-based assessments, indicating strong performance.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 23?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: 'Questions' defining the survey fields and their rubrics, and 'Responses' containing individual respondent data. Each respondent is uniquely identified and provides answers across ten distinct fields, including open-ended text and numerical scores based on a 0-3 rubric scale. The rubric scores consistently evaluate different aspects of performance, such as identification, situation assessment, and recommendations. This structure allows for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of respondent performance in simulated scenarios.

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 19?
</task>","The dataset comprises survey responses from three distinct respondents, each identified by a unique number. Each respondent's entry includes ten data points, consisting of open-ended text fields such as 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', alongside numerical scores for various performance criteria. These numerical scores, like 'Identification' and 'Situation', are based on a rubric scale typically ranging from 0 to 3, with higher values indicating better performance or confidence. The 'Questions' section acts as a comprehensive schema, defining each survey item and its corresponding scoring rubric. This structured format allows for direct retrieval of specific data points for individual respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the date for respondent 14?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from multiple respondents, each identified by a unique number. For each respondent, there are ten data points, including open-ended text fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-scored fields such as 'Identification', 'Situation', and 'Assessment'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Some numerical fields, like 'Background (examination)' for Respondent 12, can contain non-standard values like -1, suggesting potential data entry anomalies or specific coding for 'not applicable'.

What is the global rating score for respondent 10?
</task>","The survey data is structured into two main sections: 'Questions' and 'Responses'. The 'Questions' section defines 10 different survey items, including open-ended text fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and rubric-based rating scales for various aspects of a session, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', and 'Recommendation'. The 'Responses' section provides individual data points for each respondent, identified by a unique number, with values corresponding to the questions. Each respondent's data includes a date, session name, numerical ratings for several criteria, and open-ended comments. The numerical ratings are mapped to descriptive text in the 'Questions' section, providing qualitative meaning to the quantitative scores.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 9?
</task>","The survey data consists of responses from multiple respondents, each providing details across ten distinct questions. Questions 1, 2, and 10 are open-ended text fields, capturing specific dates, session names, and comments. The remaining seven questions (3 through 9) are rubric-based, with scores ranging from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence based on predefined criteria. Each respondent's data is clearly delineated, allowing for direct retrieval of specific question responses for a given respondent.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 14?
</task>","The survey data consists of responses from multiple individuals, each identified by a unique respondent number. For each respondent, there are ten distinct data points, including open-ended text fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-based scores for various aspects such as 'Identification', 'Situation', and 'Background'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. The dataset shows a mix of complete and concise entries across respondents, with some comments providing additional context or time stamps.

What is the date for respondent 16?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: `Questions`, which defines the survey fields and their rubrics, and `Responses`, which contains the actual data from individual respondents. Each respondent is identified by a unique number and provides answers across 10 distinct fields. These fields include open-ended text entries for `Date`, `SessionName`, and `Comments`, as well as numerical ratings (0-3) for various clinical assessment criteria like `Identification`, `Situation`, and `Assessment`. The dataset currently includes responses from three different respondents (16, 17, 20), each providing a complete set of data points for all questions.
