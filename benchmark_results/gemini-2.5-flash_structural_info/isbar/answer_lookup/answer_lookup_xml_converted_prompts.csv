<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 17?
</task>","The XML data describes a questionnaire structure with ten distinct questions, each identified by an ID and a description, some including detailed rubrics for scoring. Following the questions, there's a responses section containing data from three unique respondents, identified by numerical IDs (17, 19, 14). Each respondent's block lists answers to all ten questions, with some answers being open-ended text (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and others being numerical scores based on the defined rubrics (e.g., Identification, Situation, Assessment). The numerical scores for rubric-based questions consistently fall within the 0-3 range, reflecting different levels of performance or confidence as per the question definitions.

What is the date for respondent 13?
</task>","The XML data structures a questionnaire, separating question definitions from respondent answers. The `questions` section provides metadata for 10 distinct questions, including their IDs, descriptions, and whether they are open-ended or rubric-scored. The `responses` section contains data from 3 unique respondents, each identified by an ID, with nested `answer` tags linking back to the question IDs. Answers include dates, session names, numerical scores for rubric-based assessments, and open-ended comments. This structure allows for clear mapping of individual responses to predefined questions and their scoring rubrics.

What is the global rating score for respondent 17?
</task>","The XML data structures a questionnaire with a `questions` section defining question IDs, descriptions, and scoring rubrics, and a `responses` section containing individual `respondent` entries. Each respondent is identified by an ID and provides `answer` values linked to specific question IDs. Questions are either open-ended (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) or rubric-based, with scores typically ranging from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. This structure allows for detailed recording and retrieval of specific session attributes and performance evaluations for each participant.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 2?
</task>","The XML data structures a questionnaire with a `questions` section defining question IDs, descriptions, and rubrics, and a `responses` section containing answers from multiple respondents. Each respondent is uniquely identified and provides answers to various questions, including open-ended text fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and rubric-scored fields such as 'Identification' and 'Assessment'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Comments are also open-ended, providing qualitative feedback for each session.

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document, comprising a `questions` section that defines the survey's schema and a `responses` section containing individual respondent data. Each question has a unique `id` and a description, with some questions being open-ended and others using a 0-3 rubric scale. The `responses` section lists respondents by `id`, each with `answer` tags linking to specific questions. A common pattern observed is that all respondents in this dataset scored highly (3) for ""Identification"" and ""Situation"". The ""SessionName"" and ""Comments"" fields are open-ended, capturing specific details and qualitative feedback.

<task>
What is the session name for respondent 11?
</task>","The XML data is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the schema for the questionnaire, listing each question by ID, its full text, and whether it's open-ended or rubric-based with specific scoring details. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each uniquely identified by an ID, and includes `answer` tags that map to the question IDs with their corresponding values. Most answers are numerical ratings based on rubrics, while fields like ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" are open-ended text. This dataset includes responses from three distinct respondents (IDs 11, 9, and 13), each providing a complete set of answers for all ten questions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 5?
</task>","The dataset is structured with a `questionnaire` root, containing `questions` and `responses` sections. The `questions` section defines the available questions, their IDs, and rubrics for scoring, acting as a schema. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each identified by an `id`, and lists `answer` tags for various questions, providing the specific data points. Numerical scores are used for rubric-based questions, while open-ended questions store direct text.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 20?
</task>","The XML data structures a questionnaire with distinct questions and corresponding responses from multiple respondents. Each question is identified by an ID and includes a description, with some questions providing a numerical rubric for scoring. Responses are grouped by respondent ID, where each answer links to a specific question ID and contains the recorded value. A clear pattern of numerical scoring (0-3) is evident for performance-based questions, while fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName' capture open-ended text. The dataset allows for detailed evaluation of clinical skills based on predefined criteria.

What is the session name for respondent 3?
</task>","The dataset contains information about questionnaire responses from different respondents. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers to a set of predefined questions, including the date, session name, and various rubric-scored assessments of performance (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). There are also open-ended fields for comments. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. The data is structured hierarchically, with questions defined globally and responses nested under individual respondent IDs.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the date for respondent 15?
</task>","The dataset describes a questionnaire with 10 questions, including open-ended fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and rubric-based questions for various medical assessment criteria. Each respondent is uniquely identified by an ID, and their answers to all questions are nested under their respective respondent tags. The 'responses' section contains data for three respondents (15, 10, 9), each providing a date, session name, and numerical ratings for several assessment categories, along with optional comments. The numerical ratings correspond to specific rubrics defined in the 'questions' section, indicating levels of completeness or confidence.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured in an XML format, comprising a `questions` section that defines the schema and a `responses` section containing individual respondent data. Each `question` has a unique ID and a description, with some questions providing a rubric for numerical scoring (typically 0-3) and others being open-ended. Each `respondent` is uniquely identified by an ID and provides an `answer` for every defined question.

What is the identification score for respondent 5?
</task>","The XML data is structured into a `questionnaire` containing `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the metadata for each question, including its ID, description, and for some, a scoring rubric. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each uniquely identified and holding `answer` elements linked to specific questions. Answers include open-ended text for fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and numerical scores for rubric-based assessments such as 'Identification' and 'Situation'. The data primarily captures performance metrics and session details across different respondents.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 11?
</task>","The dataset is structured as an XML document, comprising a `questionnaire` root element that encapsulates `questions` and `responses` sections. The `questions` section serves as a schema, detailing ten distinct questions, some with open-ended formats and others with numerical rubrics. The `responses` section contains data from three unique respondents (IDs 11, 22, and 23), each providing an answer for every defined question. A notable pattern is the prevalence of high scores (typically 2 or 3) across the rubric-based questions for all respondents, suggesting generally positive evaluations. Open-ended fields like ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" capture specific textual information for each session.

What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document, containing a `questionnaire` root element with two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the survey questions, each with an `id` and a description, some including rubrics for scoring. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each identified by a unique `id`, and lists `answer` elements for various questions. Numerical scores are used for rubric-based questions, while dates, session names, and comments are open-ended text fields. The dataset currently includes responses from three respondents (IDs 1, 22, and 15).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 20?
</task>","The XML data describes a questionnaire with defined questions and recorded responses from multiple respondents. The `questions` section acts as a schema, detailing each question's ID, description, and for some, a scoring rubric. The `responses` section contains individual respondent data, identified by a unique ID, with each answer linked to a specific question. Most answers are numerical scores based on rubrics, while others are open-ended text fields like ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"". The dataset currently includes responses from three distinct respondents, providing a comprehensive set of answers for each.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document, comprising a `questions` section that defines the survey schema and a `responses` section containing individual respondent data. Each question has a unique ID and a description, with some questions providing a numerical rubric for scoring and others being open-ended. The `responses` section groups answers by `respondent` ID, where each `answer` links to a specific question ID and provides the corresponding value. Numerical scores (0-3) are used for rubric-based questions, while text strings are used for open-ended responses like session names or comments.

What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 10?
</task>","The XML data is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section serves as a schema, defining each question by an `id` and providing its description, including rubrics for scored items or indicating if it's open-ended. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each uniquely identified by an `id`, and lists `answer` elements that correspond to the `question` IDs, holding the specific data provided by that respondent. Numerical scores are used for rubric-based questions, while text strings are used for open-ended questions.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 8?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document, comprising a `questions` section that defines the survey schema and a `responses` section containing individual respondent data. Each `question` has a unique `id` and a description, with many utilizing a 0-3 rubric for scoring, while others are open-ended. The `responses` section lists multiple `respondent` entries, each identified by a unique `id`. Within each respondent's entry, `answer` tags link back to specific questions by their `question` attribute, providing the recorded value. This structure allows for clear mapping of responses to their corresponding questions and rubrics.

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The XML data is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section acts as a schema, defining each question's ID, full text, and rubrics for scoring, particularly for performance-based assessments. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each with a unique ID and a series of `answer` tags corresponding to the questions. Most answers are numerical scores ranging from 0 to 3, indicating performance levels, while fields like ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" are open-ended text. Notably, one respondent (ID 6) has an ""Identification"" score of -1, which is outside the defined rubric range of 0-3.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the date for respondent 11?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document, containing a `questionnaire` with `questions` and `responses` sections. The `questions` section defines the available questions by `id` and provides their descriptions, including whether they are open-ended or rubric-based. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each identified by an `id`, and lists their `answer`s to various questions, referencing the question `id`. This structure allows for clear mapping of responses to specific questions and respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the session name for respondent 18?
</task>","The dataset is structured with a `questionnaire` root containing `questions` (schema) and `responses` (data). Each `question` has an `id` and a description, some with rubrics for scoring. The `responses` section contains multiple `respondent` entries, each identified by an `id`. Within each `respondent`, there are `answer` tags, linking to a `question` by its `id` and containing the specific response value. This structure allows for clear mapping between questions and their corresponding answers for each respondent.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 5?
</task>","The XML data represents a questionnaire with defined questions and responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers to ten different questions, including open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-based scores for others such as 'Identification' and 'Assessment'. The 'questions' section serves as a schema, detailing the type and meaning of each data point, including rubrics for scoring. The 'responses' section contains the actual data, structured by respondent ID, with each answer linked to its corresponding question.

What is the global rating score for respondent 2?
</task>","The XML structure defines a questionnaire with distinct `questions` and `responses` sections. The `questions` section acts as a schema, detailing each question's ID, description, and answer type (open-ended or rubric-based with numerical scores). The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each identified by an ID and comprising `answer` elements linked to specific questions. Numerical values (0-3) are consistently used for rubric-based questions, while text fields capture open-ended responses like session names and comments. All respondents provide answers for every question, indicating complete data entries for each participant.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

What is the session name for respondent 1?
</task>","The XML data describes a questionnaire with various questions and responses from different respondents. Each respondent has a unique ID and provides answers to questions such as 'Date', 'SessionName', and several rubric-based assessments like 'Identification' and 'Situation'. The 'questions' section defines the ID and description for each question, while the 'responses' section contains the actual answers linked to respondent IDs and question IDs. The data primarily consists of open-ended text for session details and numerical scores for rubric-based questions, indicating a mix of qualitative and quantitative data collection.

What is the global rating score for respondent 3?
</task>","The XML data is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the schema for each question, including its ID, description, and in some cases, a rubric for scoring. The `responses` section contains individual respondent data, where each `respondent` is identified by an ID and provides `answer` tags linked to specific questions. Answers can be open-ended text or numerical scores based on the defined rubrics. This structure allows for clear mapping between questions and their corresponding answers for each respondent.

What is the identification score for respondent 15?
</task>","The XML data is structured into a `questionnaire` element, which contains two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section acts as a schema, defining ten distinct questions with unique IDs and descriptions, some of which include detailed rubrics for scoring. The `responses` section holds the actual data, with each `respondent` identified by a unique ID and containing multiple `answer` elements corresponding to the defined questions. Most answers are numerical scores ranging from 0 to 3, reflecting performance against a rubric, while fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' are open-ended text entries.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 16?
</task>","The XML data is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section acts as a schema, defining each question by an `id` and providing its description, including rubrics for scored questions and indicating open-ended fields. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each uniquely identified by an `id`, and within each respondent, `answer` tags link to specific question IDs with their corresponding values. Most answers are numerical scores reflecting performance against defined rubrics, while fields like ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" capture free-text input. This structure allows for a clear mapping of respondent answers to their respective questions and scoring criteria.

- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document containing a `questionnaire` root element. It is divided into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the schema, listing each question with its unique ID, description, and for some, a detailed rubric explaining the meaning of numerical scores. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each identified by a unique ID, and includes `answer` tags that link to specific questions and provide the recorded values. Numerical answers for rubric-based questions require mapping to their descriptive text using the provided schema.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document, comprising a `questionnaire` root element. It is logically divided into two main sections: `questions`, which serves as a schema defining each question's ID, type (open-ended or rubric-based), and description; and `responses`, which contains the actual data submitted by individual respondents. Each `respondent` is uniquely identified by an `id` and contains multiple `answer` elements, each linked to a specific question by its `question` attribute. The answers include dates, session names, and numerical scores based on predefined rubrics, along with open-ended comments.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the date for respondent 9?
</task>","The dataset contains a `questionnaire` with `questions` defining the schema and `responses` providing data from different `respondent`s. Each respondent has an `id` and provides `answer`s to various questions, identified by their `question` attribute. The answers include open-ended text for fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and numerical scores for rubric-based questions such as 'Identification' and 'Situation'. The structure allows for easy retrieval of specific answers for a given respondent and question.

What is the global rating score for respondent 14?
</task>","The XML data is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the various assessment criteria, each with a unique ID and a description, some of which include a numerical rubric (0-3) for scoring, while others are open-ended. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each identified by a unique ID, and lists their answers to the defined questions. Answers are linked to questions via their `question` attribute and contain either numerical scores or open-ended text. This structure allows for a clear mapping between questions and their corresponding answers for each respondent.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 19?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document, comprising a `questionnaire` with distinct `questions` and `responses` sections. The `questions` section serves as a schema, detailing 10 different questions, some with open-ended formats and others with a 0-3 rubric for scoring. The `responses` section contains data from three unique respondents, each identified by an ID, providing answers to all defined questions. Answers include dates, session names, numerical scores based on rubrics, and free-text comments. This structure allows for a comprehensive evaluation of each respondent across various criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the global rating score for respondent 10?
</task>","The XML data describes a questionnaire structure with defined questions and corresponding responses from multiple respondents. Each question has a unique ID and a description, indicating whether it's open-ended or uses a rubric for scoring. The responses are organized by respondent ID, with each answer linked to a specific question ID. Most rubric-based questions utilize a 0-3 scale, reflecting varying levels of performance or confidence. The dataset allows for tracking individual performance across different aspects of a session.

What is the global rating score for respondent 3?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document, containing a `questionnaire` root element with two main sections: `questions` (schema/metadata) and `responses` (actual data). The `questions` section defines 10 distinct questions, each with an `id` and a description, some including rubrics for scoring. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each identified by a unique `id`, and includes `answer` tags for each question. Most answers are numerical scores based on rubrics (e.g., Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation), while ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" are open-ended text fields. There are three respondents in this dataset (IDs 3, 21, and 1), providing a consistent set of answers across all defined questions.

What is the global rating score for respondent 9?
</task>","The XML data is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section acts as a schema, defining each question by an `id` and providing its description, including rubrics for scored questions and indicating open-ended fields. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each uniquely identified by an `id`, and lists their answers to various questions. Each answer links to a question via its `question` attribute and holds the specific response value. The data includes a mix of date, text, and numerical rubric scores.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 4?
</task>","The provided XML data represents a questionnaire with defined questions and corresponding responses. It is structured into two main sections: `questions`, which serves as a schema defining each question's ID, text, and type (open-ended or rubric-based), and `responses`. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each uniquely identified by an ID. Within each respondent's entry, `answer` tags link back to specific questions via their `question` attribute, providing the recorded data for that respondent. The data includes both open-ended text answers for fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and numerical rubric scores for performance-related questions.

- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The dataset is structured with a `questionnaire` root containing `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the available questions with their `id` and description, including open-ended and rubric-based types. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each identified by an `id`, and lists `answer` elements for various questions. Each answer links to a question by its `question` attribute and provides the corresponding value.
