<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 17?
</task>","The data consists of two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section defines the fields collected, including open-ended text fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and rubric-based fields like 'Identification' and 'Situation', which are scored from 0 to 3. The ""Responses"" section provides individual survey data for different respondents, each identified by a unique number, detailing their answers for each question. This structure allows for a clear mapping between the question definitions and the collected data points for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the session name for respondent 3?
</task>","The data consists of two main sections: ""Questions"" which defines the survey fields and their types (open-ended or rubric-based), and ""Responses"" which contains individual respondent data. Each respondent is identified by a number and has a set of answers corresponding to the questions. The ""SessionName"" field is open-ended, while other fields like ""Identification"" and ""Situation"" use a numerical rubric scale from 0 to 3.

Each question has a clear name and description, with some questions being open-ended and others using a numerical rubric from 0 to 3. The responses are grouped by respondent ID, providing specific values for each question. A common pattern observed is the consistent use of numerical scores for performance-based questions and text for descriptive fields.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the clinical assessment score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is organized into two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses,"" serving as a schema and the actual survey data, respectively. The ""Questions"" section details each survey item, specifying its type (e.g., open-ended, rubric-based) and the meaning of its values. The ""Responses"" section provides individual data entries for each respondent, identified by a unique number, with values corresponding to the questions. Data types vary, including dates, free-text comments, and numerical scores derived from rubrics, primarily on a 0-3 scale. All listed respondents have complete data for every question, with one instance of a -1 score for ""Identification.""

What is the global rating score for respondent 11?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" which defines the survey fields and their rubrics or types, and ""Responses"" which contains the individual answers from each respondent. Each respondent is uniquely identified by a number and provides data across ten different fields, including open-ended text fields like ""Date"" and ""SessionName"", and rubric-based scores for performance metrics. A consistent pattern observed is that all respondents scored 3 for ""Identification"", indicating complete self, role, and patient identification. The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" scores are generally high (2 or 3), suggesting a good level of confidence in the patient picture received.

What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from multiple respondents, each identified by a unique number. For each respondent, various aspects of a session are rated or recorded, including the date, session name, and several performance metrics like 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', along with 'Comments'. Most performance metrics are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating increasing levels of completeness or quality, while 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' are open-ended text fields. The structure is consistent across all respondents, allowing for direct comparison of scores and qualitative data.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" which defines the survey schema with field names and their corresponding rubrics or types, and ""Responses"" which contains individual survey submissions. Each respondent's data is clearly separated and identified by a unique respondent ID. Within each respondent's entry, there are key-value pairs where keys match the question names and values are either open-ended text (like Date, SessionName, Comments) or numerical ratings (0-3) that correspond to specific rubric descriptions. A common pattern is the use of Roman numerals in the `SessionName` field, often followed by a medical condition.

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The data is organized into two main sections: ""Questions"" which defines the survey fields and their rubrics or types, and ""Responses"" which contains the collected data for individual respondents. Most questions are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence, while others like ""Date"", ""SessionName"", and ""Comments"" are open-ended text fields. Respondent IDs are unique, and each respondent has a complete set of answers for all defined questions. A notable pattern is the consistent use of rubrics for performance-based assessments, although one respondent (Respondent 6) has an 'Identification' score of -1, which falls outside the typical 0-3 rubric range.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 19?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" which defines the survey fields and their rubrics, and ""Responses"" which contains the actual data from individual participants. There are ten distinct questions, some being open-ended (e.g., Date, SessionName, Comments) and others being rubric-based numerical ratings (e.g., Identification, Situation, Assessment). The ""Responses"" section provides data for three respondents (19, 6, and 23), with each respondent having a complete set of answers for all ten questions. Numerical scores for rubric-based questions typically range from 0 to 3, although one instance of -1 is observed for Respondent 6's Identification. The data allows for both quantitative analysis of performance metrics and qualitative insights from open-ended comments.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 3?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" defining the survey fields and their rubrics, and ""Responses"" containing individual respondent data. Each respondent is uniquely identified and provides answers for all defined questions, including open-ended text fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and numerical scores for rubric-based questions such as 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. The numerical scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence as detailed in the rubrics. The dataset includes responses from three distinct respondents, allowing for comparison of their performance across various criteria.

The responses are clearly delineated by respondent ID, with each respondent providing a value for every question. This structure allows for easy retrieval of specific data points for any given respondent and question. The rubrics provide a standardized scale for evaluating performance across different aspects of the session.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the identification score for respondent 1?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" which define the survey schema with open-ended and rubric-based fields, and ""Responses"" which contain individual respondent data. Each respondent's entry includes a date, session name, and scores for various performance aspects like Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation, along with open-ended comments. The performance criteria are consistently rated on a rubric scale, typically from 0 to 3, indicating increasing levels of proficiency. A common pattern observed across the sample respondents is high scores (2 or 3) for initial aspects like ""Identification"" and ""Situation"". The ""Comments"" field provides qualitative feedback, sometimes including time-related notes.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
What is the global rating score for respondent 14?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: ""Questions"" and ""Responses"". The ""Questions"" section defines the survey fields, including their names, descriptions, and rubrics for scoring, indicating a mix of open-ended and rubric-based questions. The ""Responses"" section contains individual respondent data, with each respondent identified by a number and their answers listed for each question. A pattern observed is that most rubric-based scores are high (2 or 3), suggesting generally positive feedback across respondents for various aspects like identification, situation, and assessment. The ""Comments"" field provides qualitative feedback, complementing the quantitative scores.

What is the identification score for respondent 19?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from multiple respondents, each identified by a unique number. For each respondent, various aspects of a session are rated or recorded, including the date, session name, and several performance metrics like 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', along with 'Comments'. Most performance metrics are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating increasing levels of completeness or quality, while 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' are open-ended text fields.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
