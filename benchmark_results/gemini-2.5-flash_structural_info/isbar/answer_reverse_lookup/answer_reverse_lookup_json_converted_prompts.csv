<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: `questions` which defines the rubric and type for each assessment criterion, and `responses` which contains the individual scores and answers for each respondent. Most assessment criteria are scored on a 0-3 rubric, indicating a progression from poor to excellent performance. There are also open-ended fields for session details and comments. A common pattern observed is high scores (typically 3) across ""Identification"", ""Situation"", and ""Background"" categories for all respondents, suggesting a baseline competence in these areas. However, scores for ""Assessment"" and ""Recommendation"" show more variability among respondents. The ""Comments"" section provides qualitative feedback, complementing the numerical scores.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three different individuals (respondents 4, 9, and 6) across ten distinct questions, including open-ended text fields and rubric-scored assessments. Each respondent provides a date, session name, and scores for various clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, with higher scores generally indicating better performance or confidence, while some fields like 'Comments' allow for qualitative feedback. The 'Identification' field for respondent 6 shows a score of -1, which is an outlier compared to the defined rubric range of 0-3.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two primary components: `questions`, which serves as a schema defining 10 assessment criteria, and `responses`, containing the actual data from three distinct respondents. The `questions` section includes both open-ended fields (e.g., 'Date', 'Comments') and rubric-based scores for clinical assessment skills, with scores typically ranging from 0 to 3. The `responses` section shows that most respondents achieved high scores (2 or 3) across various clinical assessment categories, indicating generally strong performance. An interesting pattern is the consistent high scores for 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' across all respondents. Respondent 6 has an unusual '-1' score for 'Identification', which falls outside the defined rubric range of 0-3.

Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset provides clinical assessment scores for three respondents (23, 17, 15) across ten different criteria, including open-ended fields and rubric-based evaluations. Each rubric score ranges from 0 to 3, indicating proficiency levels for specific clinical skills such as identification, situation assessment, background history and examination, and recommendations. All respondents demonstrate strong performance in 'Identification' and 'Situation' assessment, consistently scoring 3 or 2. Variability is observed in 'Background (examination)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores, highlighting areas where performance differs among individuals. The 'Comments' section offers qualitative feedback, complementing the quantitative scores.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three different individuals (respondents 14, 6, and 5) across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', and 'Assessment', is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or completeness. Open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' provide qualitative information. The 'responses' section is structured with a unique 'respondent' ID and their 'answers' for each question.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset comprises evaluations for three respondents, detailing their performance across nine distinct clinical assessment criteria, each scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, alongside open-ended comments. Key assessment areas include identification, problem situation, background history and examination, assessment, and recommendations. A consistent pattern of high scores (2 or 3) is observed across most categories for all respondents, indicating generally strong performance. The ""Comments"" section offers qualitative feedback, often highlighting communication skills or specific areas for improvement. The data structure allows for a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of individual respondent performance in clinical scenarios.

Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main parts: `questions` defining the assessment criteria with rubrics and open-ended fields, and `responses` containing individual respondent data. Most clinical assessment categories, such as Identification, Situation, and Assessment, are evaluated using a 0-3 numerical rubric, where 3 represents the highest level of performance. The `responses` section provides specific scores for each respondent across these criteria, along with textual answers for open-ended questions like Date and Comments.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about clinical assessment scores for different respondents, with each respondent identified by a unique number. The 'questions' section defines various assessment criteria, including 'Situation', which is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. The 'responses' section provides the scores for each respondent across these criteria. The task is to find the respondent with a 'Situation' score of 2.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three individuals (respondents 5, 9, and 4) across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as Identification, Situation, and Assessment, is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Several fields, like Date and SessionName, are open-ended, while others are rubric-based. The 'Comments' field also allows for open-ended feedback.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good identification score (2)?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: `questions`, which serves as a schema defining various assessment criteria and their rubric scores, and `responses`, containing individual respondent data. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers for ten different fields, including open-ended text fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-scored fields for clinical assessment. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Across the three respondents, scores for 'Situation', 'Background (examination)', and 'Assessment' are generally high (2 or 3). 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' show some variation, with scores of 2 and 3 present.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset is structured with a `questions` section detailing assessment criteria and a `responses` section containing individual respondent data. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers across various categories, including session details and clinical assessment scores. Most clinical assessment fields utilize a rubric scale from 0 to 3, indicating performance levels, while some fields are open-ended for qualitative input. An outlier score of -1 is present for ""Background (examination)"" for one respondent, which is outside the typical 0-3 rubric range. The ""Comments"" section offers additional qualitative feedback for each session.

Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset provides structured evaluations of clinical sessions for three respondents, identified by numerical IDs. Each respondent's performance is graded across nine specific clinical assessment criteria, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and two types of 'Recommendation' scores, using a rubric scale typically from 0 to 3. Additionally, there are open-ended fields for 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', offering qualitative details about each session. The data shows varying performance levels across respondents, with some excelling in certain areas while others demonstrate room for improvement, particularly in the recommendation categories.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main sections: `questions`, which serves as a schema defining various assessment criteria with their respective rubrics, and `responses`, an array containing individual respondent data. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers across ten fields, including open-ended text for `Date`, `SessionName`, and `Comments`, and rubric-based scores for clinical assessment categories. The rubric scores, ranging from 0 to 3, quantify performance in areas like `Identification`, `Situation`, `Background`, `Assessment`, and `Recommendation`. A notable pattern is the consistent high scores (often 3) for initial assessment stages such as `Identification` and `Situation` across all respondents. Variability in scores is more apparent in `Assessment` and `Recommendation` categories, suggesting these areas might differentiate performance more significantly.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The provided data details assessment scores for various clinical skills across multiple respondents. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID, and their performance is rated on a rubric scale for categories like Identification, Situation, Background (history/examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Most scores range from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating comprehensive performance. Open-ended fields capture session details and general comments.

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three individuals (10, 20, 12) across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification' or 'Assessment', is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Open-ended fields like 'Date' and 'Comments' capture specific details or qualitative feedback. The 'respondent' field uniquely identifies each entry, allowing for direct lookup of their performance across all assessed areas.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset comprises responses from three individuals, each identified by a unique respondent ID. For each respondent, there are nine scored categories related to clinical assessment, ranging from 0 to 3, and two open-ended fields for date, session name, and comments. Most respondents exhibit high scores (2 or 3) across the assessment criteria, indicating generally strong performance. Specifically, the `Background (examination)` and `Assessment` categories show some score variation, including instances of score 1. The `Recommendation (global rating scale)` also presents a mix of scores, reflecting different levels of confidence in the patient assessment.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session evaluations from three respondents (19, 5, 7), each providing scores across various clinical assessment criteria. All numerical scores, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)', are rubric-based, ranging from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' capture specific details or qualitative feedback. A common pattern is that most respondents score highly (3) in many categories, indicating good performance, though some scores vary, highlighting areas for improvement or specific characteristics.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main components: a `questions` dictionary, which serves as a schema defining 10 survey fields with their types and rubrics, and a `responses` list, containing the answers from three distinct respondents. Most fields, particularly those related to background and identification, are scored on a 0-3 rubric, with higher scores indicating better performance. A common pattern observed is that respondents generally achieve high scores (often 3) across many clinical assessment categories like 'Identification' and 'Background (history/examination)'. However, there is some variability in 'Situation', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation' scores among the respondents. The 'Comments' field provides qualitative feedback, while 'Date' and 'SessionName' are open-ended identifiers for each session.
