<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, each identified by a unique Respondent ID. Each respondent's data includes session details like date and name, along with scores across several clinical assessment categories such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Scores for these categories are typically integers ranging from 0 to 3, indicating proficiency levels based on defined rubrics. Additionally, there's a Global Rating Scale score and open-ended comments. The structure allows for a detailed evaluation of each respondent's performance in a clinical scenario.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about survey respondents, including session details, identification, situation assessment, background history and examination, overall assessment, and recommendation scores. Each question has a defined rubric, mapping numerical scores to qualitative descriptions, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest). The data is structured with unique identifiers for each respondent and specific predicates for each survey question, allowing for direct lookup of scores. Most respondents show high scores across various clinical assessment categories, indicating generally good performance.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset consists of survey responses from individual persons, each identified by a unique respondent ID. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and scores across several clinical assessment categories, along with open-ended comments. The clinical assessment categories, such as Identification, Situation, Background_history, Background_examination, Assessment, and Recommendation, are scored on a rubric typically ranging from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or completeness. The `pred:Date`, `pred:SessionName`, and `pred:Comments` fields are open-ended text, providing qualitative information about the session. Overall, the data provides a structured evaluation of clinical performance based on predefined criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents, each providing scores across various clinical assessment criteria. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and scores for identification, situation, background history, background examination, assessment, clear recommendation, and global rating scale, along with open-ended comments. The scores for most criteria are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance based on defined rubrics. This structured format allows for quantitative analysis of clinical skills and qualitative insights from comments.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The provided data describes survey responses from different individuals, each identified by a unique Respondent ID. Each respondent's data includes various clinical assessment scores, such as Identification, Situation, Background history, Background examination, Assessment, and Recommendation, along with open-ended fields for Date, Session Name, and Comments. All clinical assessment scores are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, with higher numbers generally indicating better performance according to the rubrics provided in the questions schema. The dataset is structured to allow for direct lookup of specific scores for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents. Each respondent's data includes session details like date and name, along with scores across several clinical assessment criteria such as identification, situation assessment, background history, examination, overall assessment, and recommendation clarity. Scores for these criteria range from 0 to 3, with higher numbers generally indicating better performance or confidence, as detailed in the rubrics. Additionally, there's a global rating scale and open-ended comments for each session.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","The dataset contains information about survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents. Each respondent's data includes session details like date and name, along with scores for various clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background history, Background examination, Assessment, and Recommendation. The scores for these criteria are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, with higher numbers generally indicating better performance according to the provided rubrics.

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The data is structured using RDF triples, with specific predicates for various clinical assessment criteria and general session information. Each respondent is identified as a `:Person` and has scores for ten different attributes, along with open-ended fields for date, session name, and comments. Numerical scores, typically ranging from 0 to 3, indicate performance levels based on defined rubrics, while some fields are open-ended text. A notable pattern is the consistent high scores (3) for 'Identification' and 'Situation' across all respondents in this dataset. The 'Background_examination' score for Respondent12 is an outlier at -1, suggesting a potential data entry or assessment issue.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The data describes survey responses from different individuals, identified by unique respondent IDs. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and scores across several clinical assessment categories such as identification, situation, background history, background examination, assessment, and recommendation, along with a global rating scale and open-ended comments. The scores for clinical assessment categories are rubric-based, ranging from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of proficiency or completeness. The dataset allows for quantitative analysis of performance in different clinical skills and qualitative insights from comments.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from multiple individuals, each identified by a unique Respondent ID. Each respondent's data includes open-ended fields like session date, session name, and comments, alongside several rubric-scored fields assessing clinical skills. These rubric scores, ranging typically from 0 to 3, quantify performance in areas such as identification, situation assessment, history, examination, assessment, and recommendation. The `pred:Comments` field offers qualitative feedback, complementing the quantitative scores.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents, each with various attributes such as session date, name, and scores across several clinical assessment categories. Each category, like 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background_history', 'Background_examination', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or completeness. Additionally, there are open-ended fields for session details and comments. The data is structured using RDF-like triples, linking respondents to their specific scores and textual responses.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The data describes survey responses from different individuals, each identified by a unique Respondent ID. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and scores across several clinical assessment categories such as Identification, Situation, Background history, Background examination, Assessment, and Recommendation, along with a Global Rating Scale score and comments. All scores are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, with higher values generally indicating better performance or confidence as per the rubrics provided in the questions schema. The dataset contains three distinct respondents, each with a complete set of scores for the defined predicates.

Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains responses from three individuals, each evaluated across ten distinct clinical assessment criteria. Most criteria are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of proficiency, with 3 being the highest. There are also open-ended fields for session date, name, and comments. A notable pattern is that many respondents score highly (3) on initial identification and situation assessment. The data allows for direct comparison of performance on specific clinical skills.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The provided data consists of survey responses from different individuals, each identified as a `Respondent`. Each respondent's entry includes session-specific details like `Date` and `SessionName`, along with various clinical assessment scores and open-ended `Comments`. The assessment scores are numerical, typically ranging from 0 to 3, with higher values generally indicating better performance or confidence, as detailed in the rubrics provided in the 'Questions' section. Several fields, such as `Identification`, `Situation`, `Background_history`, `Background_examination`, `Assessment`, `Recommendation_clear_recommendation`, and `Recommendation_global_rating_scale`, are scored based on these rubrics.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset consists of individual respondent profiles, each identified by a unique number, detailing their performance across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification' or 'Assessment', is scored numerically, typically on a rubric scale from 0 to 3, where higher values generally indicate better performance. In addition to these quantitative scores, there are open-ended fields for session details like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and qualitative 'Comments'. A common pattern observed is that many respondents achieve high scores (2 or 3) across multiple assessment categories, indicating a generally proficient group.

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset comprises individual respondent profiles, each detailing a session's date, name, and performance across nine distinct clinical assessment categories, along with open-ended comments. Most assessment categories are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of proficiency, from requiring significant prompting to performing unprompted and comprehensively. A prevalent pattern shows respondents frequently achieving high scores (typically 2 or 3) across multiple clinical assessment metrics, suggesting a generally competent performance. The `Comments` field offers qualitative insights, providing additional context to the quantitative scores. The structure allows for a detailed evaluation of each respondent's clinical skills based on standardized rubrics.

Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The data describes survey responses from different individuals, identified by unique Respondent IDs. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and scores across several clinical assessment categories such as Identification, Situation, Background history, Background examination, Assessment, and Recommendation, along with a Global Rating Scale score and open-ended comments. The scores for clinical assessment categories are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, with higher numbers generally indicating better performance or more comprehensive information. The dataset allows for direct querying of specific scores for particular assessment criteria across respondents.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The data is structured as RDF triples, defining survey questions with rubrics and individual respondent answers. Most questions are scored on a 0-3 rubric scale, indicating performance levels, while others are open-ended text fields. The rubrics consistently define higher scores as better performance, such as ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"" for a score of 3 in assessment. Respondents generally exhibit high scores across various clinical assessment categories, with many achieving scores of 2 or 3. Qualitative comments provide additional context to the numerical scores, highlighting specific strengths or areas for improvement.

The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents. Each respondent has a set of attributes including session details (Date, SessionName) and various clinical assessment scores. The scores for 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background_history', 'Background_examination', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation', and 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' are rubric-based, ranging from 0 to 3, with higher scores generally indicating better performance or confidence. 'Comments' is an open-ended text field for additional feedback.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified by unique respondent IDs. Each respondent's data includes session details like date and name, along with scores across several clinical assessment categories such as identification, situation, background history, examination, assessment, and recommendation. Scores for these categories are typically on a rubric scale from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of proficiency or completeness, with higher numbers generally representing better performance. Additionally, there's a global rating scale and an open-ended comments section for qualitative feedback. The data structure allows for direct querying of specific scores for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good identification score (2)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents. Each respondent's data includes session details like date and name, along with scores across several clinical assessment categories such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Scores are typically on a rubric scale from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of completeness or proficiency. Additionally, there's a Global Rating Scale and an open-ended comments section. The structure is consistent across all respondents, allowing for direct comparison of scores for specific criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about three respondents, each with various clinical assessment scores and session details. Each respondent's data includes a session date, name, and scores across nine different clinical assessment categories, along with open-ended comments. The scores for categories like Identification, Situation, Background_history, Background_examination, Assessment, and Recommendation_clear_recommendation range from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance based on defined rubrics. The Global Rating Scale also uses a 0-3 rubric to assess confidence in the patient picture.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents, each providing scores across various clinical assessment criteria. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and scores for identification, situation assessment, background history, background examination, logical assessment, clear recommendation, and a global rating scale, along with open-ended comments. The scores for most criteria range from 0 to 3, indicating a rubric-based evaluation of performance, where 0 typically signifies the lowest performance (e.g., requiring direct prompting or being unable to identify problems). The data is structured using RDF-like triples, linking respondents to their specific scores and comments.

All respondents have high scores (2 or 3) in most clinical assessment categories, indicating generally good performance. Specifically, 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background_history', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' are frequently scored at 3. 'Background_examination' and 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' show some variability, with scores of 2 appearing for some respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents, each providing scores across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background_history', 'Background_examination', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation', and 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', is rated on a numerical rubric, typically from 0 to 3, indicating proficiency levels. Additionally, open-ended fields capture session details like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments'. The data is structured to evaluate clinical performance, with higher scores generally indicating better performance, and includes specific comments for qualitative feedback.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The data consists of individual respondent profiles, each identified by a unique number, detailing their performance across several clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification' or 'Assessment', is scored numerically, typically on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 representing the lowest performance and 3 the highest, as defined by specific rubrics. Additionally, each respondent provides a session date, name, and open-ended comments. The structure allows for quantitative evaluation of clinical skills and qualitative feedback.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about different respondents, each identified by a unique ID. Each respondent has various attributes, including session details, and scores for different clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background history, Background examination, Assessment, and Recommendation. The scores are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, with higher scores generally indicating better performance based on the rubrics provided in the questions section. Additionally, there are open-ended fields for session date, name, and comments.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents, each providing scores across various clinical assessment criteria. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and numerical scores for aspects like identification, situation assessment, background history, background examination, overall assessment, clear recommendation, and global rating scale, along with open-ended comments. The scores, ranging from 0 to 3, indicate proficiency levels based on defined rubrics, where 0 typically signifies the lowest performance and 3 the highest. This structure allows for a quantitative evaluation of clinical skills for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, identified as Respondents. Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and scores across several clinical assessment categories such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation, along with a Global Rating Scale and comments. All scores for clinical assessment categories are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of proficiency as defined by the rubrics. The data appears to be structured to evaluate clinical performance based on specific criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset describes survey responses from different individuals, each identified by a unique Respondent ID. Each respondent's data includes session details like date and name, and scores across several clinical assessment categories such as Identification, Situation, Background history, Background examination, Assessment, and Recommendation, along with a Global Rating Scale score and open-ended comments. All assessment scores are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance based on defined rubrics. The structure is consistent across all respondents, allowing for direct comparison of scores for specific criteria.
