<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains survey responses from three distinct respondents (11, 16, 18), each providing details on a clinical session. For each session, there are two open-ended fields (Date, SessionName, Comments) and seven rubric-based assessment scores ranging from 0 to 3. A consistent pattern across all respondents is high scores (typically 3) for initial clinical steps like Identification, Situation, and Background. Variability in scores is more apparent in the Assessment and Recommendation categories, highlighting individual differences in these complex areas.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset is structured into two main parts: a 'Questions' section detailing survey fields with their rubrics, and a 'Responses' section containing data from three distinct respondents. Most survey items, such as 'Identification' and 'Assessment', are evaluated using a numerical rubric, typically ranging from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance. Fields like 'Date' and 'Comments' are open-ended text entries. A common pattern observed is high scores (often 3) across multiple clinical assessment categories for most respondents, suggesting generally strong performance. Notably, Respondent 12 has an anomalous score of -1 for 'Background (examination)', which deviates from the established rubric.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from multiple respondents, each providing scores for various clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Scores are typically on a rubric scale from 0 to 3, indicating increasing levels of completeness or independence in performance. Additionally, there are open-ended fields for Date, Session Name, and Comments. The structure allows for a quantitative evaluation of clinical skills alongside qualitative feedback.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The data consists of a set of survey questions with their rubrics and responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent's data includes a date, session name, and scores for various clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation (clear recommendation and global rating scale), along with open-ended comments. The scores for most criteria range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. The structure is consistent across all respondents, allowing for direct comparison of scores for specific criteria.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background examination score (2)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (20, 11, 19), detailing their performance across several clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric typically ranging from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance. Open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' provide contextual information and qualitative feedback. The scores reveal varying levels of proficiency among respondents in different aspects of clinical assessment and communication.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains survey responses from three respondents (23, 6, 12) across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Some fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' are open-ended. Notably, some scores, like 'Identification' for Respondent 6 and 'Background (examination)' for Respondent 12, contain negative values, which deviate from the defined rubric range of 0-3.

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (11, 20, 7), each providing scores for various clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. All respondents provided a date and session name, with scores ranging from 2 to 3 for most rubric-based questions, indicating generally good performance. The 'Comments' field is open-ended, with some respondents providing feedback while others leave it blank. The structure allows for a clear comparison of individual performance across standardized clinical assessment metrics.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The provided data consists of survey responses from three respondents (4, 9, and 6) on various aspects of a clinical session. Each respondent's data includes a date, session name, and scores for several clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation, along with open-ended comments. The scores for most criteria are based on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating increasing levels of completeness or proficiency, while 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' are open-ended. The 'Identification' score for Respondent 6 is an outlier at -1, suggesting a potential data entry error or a unique scoring convention not defined in the rubric.

Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (6, 8, and 7), each providing scores for various clinical assessment criteria, along with open-ended date, session name, and comments. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance or confidence. All respondents provided a date of 2025-04-04. Most scores across respondents are high (3), indicating strong performance in many areas, though some scores like 'Identification' for Respondent 6 (-1) and 'Assessment' for Respondent 7 (2) show variation.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","Structural Information, Patterns, and Statistics:
The dataset comprises survey responses from three distinct respondents (23, 17, 15), each identified by a unique numerical ID. Each respondent's data includes a date, session name, and scores across seven clinical assessment categories, along with open-ended comments. All respondents achieved a perfect score of 3 for 'Identification' and 'Situation' (except Respondent 23 for 'Situation' which is 2). Scores for 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' vary, indicating different levels of performance in these areas. The 'Comments' section provides qualitative feedback, offering additional context to the numerical scores.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from multiple respondents, each evaluated across several clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Most fields are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance, with 0 typically representing the lowest score (e.g., ""Requires direct prompting"" for Identification). There are also open-ended fields for Date, SessionName, and Comments. The responses show a mix of scores across respondents, with some respondents achieving high scores in most categories while others have lower scores in specific areas.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The data is organized into two main sections: a ""Questions"" section detailing the survey's structure and rubrics, and a ""Responses"" section containing individual respondent data. Each question, except for open-ended ones, is associated with a numerical rubric, typically ranging from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Respondents are identified by a unique number and provide scores for various clinical assessment criteria, along with open-ended date, session name, and comments. A common pattern observed is high scores (2 or 3) across most clinical assessment categories for the respondents provided.

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (18, 20, 15), each providing scores for various clinical assessment criteria and open-ended comments. Most criteria are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating increasing levels of completeness or confidence. All respondents consistently score high (3) on 'Identification' and 'Situation'. The 'Assessment' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' categories show more variability, with scores of 2 and 3 across respondents. The 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' scores are generally high, with some instances of a score of 2.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (1, 8, and 7), each providing scores for various clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. All scores are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, with higher values generally indicating better performance or confidence, as defined by the rubrics in the 'Questions' section. The 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' fields are open-ended text. The dataset is structured clearly with distinct sections for questions and individual responses, allowing for direct lookup of specific criteria scores for each respondent.

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The provided data consists of survey responses from three respondents (15, 19, and 12) across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, indicating the level of performance or confidence. Open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' provide qualitative information. Most respondents show high scores (3) across many categories, indicating strong performance, though some scores of 2 are present, signifying a slightly lower but still good level of performance, such as ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". One respondent (12) has an unusual score of -1 for 'Background (examination)', which deviates from the defined rubric.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The data presents survey responses from three distinct respondents (6, 8, and 4), each detailing scores across nine clinical assessment criteria and two open-ended fields. The assessment scores are primarily rubric-based, ranging from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance or confidence. A notable pattern is the prevalence of high scores (3) across most categories for respondents 6 and 8, suggesting strong performance. Respondent 4, however, exhibits a mix of scores, including some lower values (1 and 2), indicating areas for potential improvement. An outlier score of -1 for 'Identification' for Respondent 6 suggests a possible data entry error or an unstated scoring convention.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains survey responses from three respondents (14, 6, and 5) across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)', is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance. Open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' provide additional contextual information. A notable pattern is the consistent use of numerical scores for performance metrics, although one respondent (6) has an out-of-range score for 'Identification'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (20, 3, 21), each providing scores across several clinical assessment categories, along with open-ended date, session name, and comments. Most categories are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence. Common patterns include high scores for 'Identification' and 'Situation', while 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation' scores show more variability. The 'Comments' section provides qualitative feedback for each session.

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The data is structured into a 'Questions' section, which serves as a schema defining various survey fields and their scoring rubrics, and a 'Responses' section, containing individual data entries for each respondent. Most fields are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence, while 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' are open-ended. A common pattern observed is high scores (typically 2 or 3) across most clinical assessment categories for all respondents, suggesting a generally strong performance. For instance, 'Identification' consistently received a perfect score of 3 from all listed respondents. The 'Comments' section provides qualitative feedback, sometimes noting areas for improvement or positive aspects of the session.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from multiple individuals, each identified by a unique respondent number. For each respondent, various aspects of a clinical session are evaluated using a rubric-based scoring system, typically ranging from 0 to 3, indicating increasing levels of completeness or proficiency. There are also open-ended fields for date, session name, and comments. The structure allows for a detailed assessment of clinical skills, with specific rubrics defining the meaning of each score for categories like 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation'.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: 'Questions' which defines the survey fields and their scoring rubrics, and 'Responses' which contains the actual data from individual respondents. Each respondent's entry includes open-ended fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments, alongside several scored clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. The scoring for these criteria typically ranges from 0 to 3, where a score of 1 generally indicates that the action or information was provided only after extended questioning or required significant clarification. This structure allows for a detailed evaluation of clinical performance across multiple dimensions for each respondent.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The provided data consists of survey responses from three respondents (4, 21, 15) across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' provide qualitative information. All respondents scored highly (3) on 'Identification' and 'Situation', indicating complete self-identification and problem identification. However, scores for 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation' vary, suggesting different levels of detail and clarity in their clinical assessments.

<task>
Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The data presents survey responses from three distinct respondents, each evaluated across a set of clinical assessment criteria. The criteria include open-ended fields like 'Date' and 'Comments', and rubric-scored fields such as 'Identification', 'Situation', and 'Assessment', typically ranging from 0 to 3. A notable pattern is the consistent high scoring (2 or 3) across most rubric categories for all respondents, indicating a generally satisfactory performance level. However, Respondent 12 has an anomalous score of -1 for 'Background (examination)', which falls outside the defined rubric range. Overall, the dataset provides a structured overview of individual performance in a clinical session context.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains survey responses from three respondents (5, 9, 4) across various clinical assessment categories. Each category, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' provide additional contextual information. The structure allows for a detailed evaluation of clinical handover skills based on specific criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The data is organized into two main sections: 'Questions' defining the survey structure and rubrics, and 'Responses' containing individual respondent data. The 'Questions' section details various assessment criteria, including open-ended fields and rubric-based scores typically ranging from 0 to 3. The 'Responses' section provides specific scores and comments for each respondent, with a notable instance of a score outside the defined rubric range. Overall, the dataset allows for quantitative assessment of performance across several clinical skills, supplemented by qualitative feedback.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (16, 5, and 10), detailing their performance across several clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Each criterion is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating the lowest performance (e.g., ""Requires direct prompting"" for Identification) and 3 indicating the highest (e.g., ""Introduces themselves and information is complete""). The dataset also includes open-ended fields for Date, Session Name, and Comments.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The data is structured with a ""Questions"" section defining various assessment criteria and their corresponding rubrics, and a ""Responses"" section providing individual scores for three respondents. Most criteria use a numerical rubric from 0 to 3, while others are open-ended. A clear pattern emerges where respondents generally score high (3) on foundational aspects like Identification, Situation, and Background. However, there is more variability in scores for ""Recommendation"" and ""Global Rating Scale"", indicating differing levels of performance in these areas. Respondent 3 notably has lower scores in the recommendation categories compared to the others.

Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The provided data consists of a set of survey questions with their respective rubrics and responses from three different respondents. Each respondent's data includes a date, session name, and scores for various clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation (clear recommendation and global rating scale), along with open-ended comments. The scores for most criteria range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence as defined by the rubrics.

Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains survey responses from three respondents (10, 5, 8) across various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric typically ranging from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. Open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' provide qualitative information. The structure allows for a quantitative evaluation of clinical skills alongside descriptive feedback.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The data presents survey responses from three distinct individuals, identified by Respondent IDs 3, 1, and 13. Each respondent's submission includes a date, session name, and comments, alongside numerical scores for seven specific clinical assessment criteria. These scores, ranging from 0 to 3, are based on detailed rubrics provided in the 'Questions' section, indicating performance levels from requiring significant prompting to comprehensive unprompted execution. A clear pattern of high scores (typically 3) is observed for 'Identification' and 'Situation' across all respondents, suggesting consistent initial performance. However, scores for 'Background', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation' categories show more variability, highlighting areas of differing proficiency among the respondents.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The data consists of a set of survey questions with their rubrics and responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent's data includes a date, session name, and scores for various clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation, along with comments. The scores for most criteria range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence based on the rubrics provided in the 'Questions' section. The structure allows for direct lookup of specific scores for each respondent across different assessment categories.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The data presents survey responses from three distinct respondents (10, 20, 12), each detailing scores across nine clinical assessment criteria and two open-ended fields. Most criteria are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, with higher numbers indicating better performance, though one instance shows an outlier score of -1. A common pattern is high scores (often 3) for 'Identification' and 'Situation' across all respondents. The 'Comments' section provides qualitative feedback, complementing the quantitative scores.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (15, 23, 11), each providing scores across several clinical assessment criteria, along with open-ended date, session name, and comments. All respondents consistently score high (3) on 'Identification' and 'Situation', indicating strong initial communication and problem identification. Scores for 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation' vary, with some respondents scoring 2 or 1, suggesting areas where further questioning or clarification was needed. The 'Global Rating Scale' also shows a mix of high confidence (3) and moderate confidence (2) in the accuracy of the patient picture. Overall, the structure provides a detailed rubric-based evaluation of clinical handover skills.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (5, 2, 10), each providing scores across several clinical assessment criteria, along with open-ended date, session name, and comments. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence. Most respondents show high scores (2 or 3) across the clinical assessment categories, suggesting generally competent performance. The 'Comments' section provides qualitative feedback, sometimes including session timings or specific observations. The structure allows for a direct comparison of individual performance against defined rubrics.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: 'Questions' which defines the survey fields and their scoring rubrics, and 'Responses' which contains the individual data entries for each respondent. Most questions are assessed using a numerical rubric from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or completeness, while a few fields are open-ended for free-text input. This allows for a standardized quantitative evaluation of clinical skills alongside qualitative comments. The dataset provides a clear framework for assessing various aspects of a clinical session, from identification to recommendations.

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from three respondents (18, 2, 10) on various clinical assessment criteria. Each criterion, such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation', is scored on a rubric typically from 0 to 3, indicating increasing levels of completeness or proficiency. Open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments' provide qualitative information. The scores for each respondent vary across the different assessment categories, allowing for individual performance evaluation.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The data consists of survey responses from multiple respondents, each evaluated across several clinical assessment criteria such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation. Most criteria are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of completeness or proficiency, with 0 typically representing the lowest performance. Open-ended fields are also present for Date, Session Name, and Comments. The responses show a mix of high and low scores across different respondents, indicating varied performance in the clinical assessments.

There are no missing values for the scored categories, though comments can be empty. Respondent 6 has an unusual '-1' score for Identification, which falls outside the defined rubric range of 0-3.
