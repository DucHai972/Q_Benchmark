<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good recommendation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about clinical session assessments for three respondents (11, 16, 18). Each respondent's performance is rated across several categories, including identification, situation assessment, background history and examination, overall assessment, and recommendations, using a rubric scale from 0 to 3. Additionally, there are open-ended fields for date, session name, and comments. All respondents scored highly (3) on identification, situation, and background history and examination.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains information from three respondents (IDs 12, 15, 19) across ten distinct questions, covering session details, clinical assessment rubrics, and open-ended comments. Each respondent provides a score for various clinical assessment criteria, ranging from identification to recommendations, typically on a scale of 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better performance. The ""Background (examination)"" question for respondent 12 has an anomalous score of -1, indicating a potential data entry error or a specific meaning not defined in the rubric. The ""Comments"" section offers qualitative feedback for each session.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session details and performance assessments for different respondents. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers to a set of standardized questions, many of which are scored using a rubric from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence. There are also open-ended fields for date, session name, and comments. The data allows for evaluation of clinical assessment skills across multiple dimensions.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The XML data is structured into two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the questionnaire's schema, detailing each question's ID, description, and for scored items, a numerical rubric from 0 to 3. The `responses` section contains individual respondent data, each identified by a unique ID, with answers provided for every question. A common pattern across respondents is the high scores (2 or 3) for initial assessment categories like 'Identification' and 'Situation'. The 'Comments' field offers qualitative feedback, complementing the quantitative scores.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session details and performance assessments across several clinical skills for three respondents. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers to ten questions, including open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-based scores for clinical assessment criteria such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', and 'Recommendation'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of proficiency, with higher scores generally representing better performance. The 'responses' section shows individual scores for each criterion, allowing for direct comparison and identification of respondents meeting specific score thresholds for particular skills.

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The data is structured into two main sections: `questions` defining the questionnaire schema and `responses` containing individual respondent data. Each question has a unique ID and a description, with many including a numerical rubric for scoring clinical assessments. The `responses` section lists respondents by ID, each providing answers to the questions, often as numerical scores or open-ended text. A common pattern observed is high scores (typically 2 or 3) across most clinical assessment categories for the respondents. One respondent has a negative score for 'Background (examination)', indicating an outlier or specific issue.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document containing a `questions` section defining the questionnaire schema and a `responses` section holding individual respondent data. Each question has an `id` and a description, with some questions providing a numerical rubric for scoring performance from 0 to 3. The `responses` section lists multiple `respondent` entries, each identified by an `id`, containing `answer` elements linked to specific questions and their corresponding values. This allows for a clear mapping of scores and open-ended answers to specific questions for each participant.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The XML data is structured into a `questionnaire` element, which contains two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines 10 different assessment criteria, including open-ended questions and rubric-based questions with scores ranging from 0 to 3. The `responses` section contains the answers from three distinct respondents, each identified by a unique ID. A common pattern observed is that respondents generally score high (2 or 3) on initial assessment items like ""Identification"" and ""Situation"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session assessments from three respondents (IDs 3, 10, 11), each providing scores across various clinical assessment criteria. All respondents have complete identification and situation scores of 3. There's variability in scores for background, assessment, and recommendation categories, with some respondents scoring lower in specific areas like history, examination, or clear recommendation. The 'Comments' section offers qualitative feedback on the sessions.

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The questionnaire collects data on clinical session performance across ten different aspects, including open-ended comments and rubric-scored evaluations from 0 to 3. Each respondent is uniquely identified by an ID. The rubric scores indicate varying levels of performance, from requiring significant prompting (0-1) to comprehensive and unprompted execution (3). The data shows consistent high scores (3) for ""Identification"" and ""Situation"" across all respondents. Several respondents scored 2 on ""Assessment"" and ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"", indicating performance after minimal or some questioning.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondent has a good situation score (2)?
</task>","The dataset describes a questionnaire with ten questions covering aspects like identification, situation assessment, background history and examination, overall assessment, and recommendations. Each question, except for open-ended ones, has a rubric defining scores from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence. The responses section contains data from three respondents, each providing answers to all questions, with numerical scores for rubric-based questions and text for open-ended ones. All respondents scored highly (2 or 3) on most clinical assessment criteria, indicating generally good performance across the board.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset describes a questionnaire with 10 questions, including open-ended fields like 'Date' and 'SessionName', and rubric-based questions for clinical assessment. Each respondent's answers are recorded, with scores ranging from 0 to 3 for most rubric questions, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. The 'Comments' section provides qualitative feedback. The data is structured to allow for easy retrieval of specific scores for each respondent across various clinical assessment criteria.

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The data is structured as an XML document containing a `questionnaire` with two main sections: `questions` and `responses`. The `questions` section defines the various assessment criteria, each with an `id` and a description, some including a detailed `Rubric` for scoring. The `responses` section contains individual `respondent` entries, each identified by an `id`, and lists their `answer` for each `question`. Scores for rubric-based questions are numerical, typically ranging from 0 to 3, indicating performance levels.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The XML data describes a questionnaire with 10 distinct questions, categorized as open-ended or rubric-based, and responses from three different individuals. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers for all defined questions, including session details, clinical assessment scores, and qualitative comments. A common pattern observed is that most respondents achieve high scores (typically 2 or 3) across various clinical assessment criteria, suggesting a generally competent performance. However, there are instances of lower scores, such as respondent 6's anomalous -1 for ""Identification"" and respondent 3's score of 1 for both recommendation categories. The ""Comments"" section offers additional qualitative insights into each session's performance.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","Structural Information, Patterns, and Statistics:
The XML data represents a questionnaire with a set of predefined questions and responses from multiple respondents. Each question has a unique ID and a description, with some questions including a rubric defining numerical scores. The responses section contains individual respondent IDs, each listing their answers to the questions, often as numerical scores corresponding to the rubrics. All respondents provided scores for all rubric-based questions, and open-ended answers for date, session name, and comments. A common pattern is that most respondents scored highly (2 or 3) across the clinical assessment categories.

</task>","The XML data structures a questionnaire with a set of defined questions and responses from three distinct respondents. Each question has a unique ID and a description, often including a rubric that defines numerical scores for performance evaluation. Respondents are identified by a unique ID, and their answers to each question are recorded, with most clinical assessment questions using a numerical rating scale. The data includes both quantitative scores for specific skills and qualitative open-ended comments about the sessions. This structure allows for a comprehensive evaluation of each respondent's performance across various clinical assessment criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session details and clinical assessment scores for three respondents. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers to ten questions, including open-ended fields like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', and rubric-based scores for clinical assessment criteria such as 'Identification', 'Situation', 'Background (history)', 'Background (examination)', 'Assessment', 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence. The data allows for analysis of individual performance across different clinical assessment aspects.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about clinical session assessments for three respondents (12, 4, 20). Each respondent's performance is evaluated across several categories, including identification, situation assessment, background history and examination, overall assessment, and recommendations, using a rubric-based scoring system from 0 to 3, with some open-ended comments. The scores indicate varying levels of proficiency, from requiring prompting to comprehensive performance without questioning.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains a questionnaire with 10 questions, including open-ended and rubric-based assessments, and responses from three different individuals. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers across various clinical assessment categories such as Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. The scores for rubric-based questions range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate recommendation score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains information from three respondents (IDs 16, 3, 18) across ten distinct questions, covering session details, clinical assessment aspects, and a global rating scale. Each clinical assessment question uses a rubric-based scoring system from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence. The responses show a general trend of high scores (2s and 3s) for identification, situation, and background, suggesting strong foundational skills. However, scores for assessment and recommendation vary more, indicating areas where performance might differ among respondents.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains information from three respondents, each providing answers to ten distinct questions related to a clinical session. The questions cover various aspects of a clinical assessment, including identification, situation assessment, background history and examination, overall assessment, and recommendations, with most questions using a rubric-based scoring system from 0 to 3. All respondents provided scores for the rubric-based questions and open-ended text for comments. The data is structured clearly, allowing for direct lookup of scores for specific questions per respondent.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<task>
Which respondent has a poor identification score (0)?
</task>","The dataset contains a questionnaire with 10 questions, including open-ended and rubric-based questions, and responses from three different respondents. Each respondent is identified by a unique ID and provides answers for all defined questions. The rubric-based questions use numerical scores (0-3) to indicate performance levels, with 0 typically representing the lowest score. The data allows for analysis of individual performance across various clinical assessment criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session details and respondent performance across several clinical assessment criteria, each with a rubric-based scoring system from 0 to 3, or open-ended comments. There are three respondents, each identified by a unique ID, providing answers to ten distinct questions. The scores indicate varying levels of proficiency in areas like identification, situation assessment, background history and examination, overall assessment, and recommendations.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session details and respondent performance across various clinical assessment criteria. Each respondent is uniquely identified by an ID and provides answers to a set of standardized questions, some of which are open-ended (like Date, SessionName, Comments) and others are scored based on a rubric (like Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of proficiency or confidence. The structure allows for a clear evaluation of individual performance in specific clinical skills.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The questionnaire collects data on clinical session performance across ten different aspects, including open-ended comments and rubric-scored evaluations. Each respondent is identified by a unique numerical ID, and their answers are recorded for each question. The rubric scores range from 0 to 3, indicating varying levels of performance or confidence, with higher scores generally representing better outcomes. Some questions, like 'Date' and 'SessionName', are open-ended, while others, like 'Assessment' and 'Recommendation', use a defined rubric. The dataset includes responses from three distinct respondents, providing a snapshot of their performance across the evaluated criteria.

<task>
Which respondent has a moderate background examination score (1)?
</task>","The questionnaire collects data on various aspects of clinical sessions, including identification, situation assessment, background history and examination, overall assessment, and recommendations. Each question, except for open-ended ones like 'Date', 'SessionName', and 'Comments', is scored on a rubric, typically from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence. The responses section provides individual scores for three respondents (9, 4, and 20) across these defined criteria. A common pattern observed is that most respondents score relatively high (2 or 3) on many clinical assessment aspects.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondent has a good background history score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains information from three respondents, each identified by a unique ID (18, 2, 10). Each respondent's data includes a session date, session name, and scores across several clinical assessment categories such as Identification, Situation, Background (history and examination), Assessment, and Recommendation, along with open-ended comments. The scores for most categories are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3, indicating different levels of performance or confidence as defined by the rubrics in the questions section. This structure allows for a quantitative evaluation of clinical skills based on predefined criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<request>
Before providing final answer, please [REQUEST]
</request>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondent has a good clinical assessment score (2)?
</task>","The dataset contains information about session details and clinical assessment scores for three respondents. Each respondent's performance is evaluated across several clinical aspects, including identification, situation assessment, background history and examination, overall assessment, and recommendations, using a rubric scale from 0 to 3. The 'Comments' field provides qualitative feedback for some sessions. The data is structured with clear question IDs and corresponding answer values for each respondent.
